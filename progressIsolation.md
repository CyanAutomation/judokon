---

## Executive Summary

The `battle-cli-play.spec.js` test **passes when run in isolation** but **fails when run with other CLI tests** (`battle-cli-start.spec.js` and `battle-cli-restart.spec.js`). The failure occurs at the stat selection step where the battle state machine fails to transition from `waitingForPlayerAction` to `roundDecision`.

This is a **test isolation/cross-contamination issue**, not a code defect. The test infrastructure does not properly clean up global JavaScript state between test runs.

---

## Detailed Failure Analysis

### Failure Symptom

```text
Error: expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality

Expected: "roundDecision"
Received: "waitingForPlayerAction"

Call Log:
- Timeout 5000ms exceeded while waiting on the predicate

Location: playwright/battle-cli-play.spec.js:46-48
```

### Reproduction Steps

1. Run: `npx playwright test playwright/battle-cli*.spec.js` (all three CLI tests)
2. Observe: First test (`battle-cli-start.spec.js`) passes ✓
3. Observe: Second test (`battle-cli-play.spec.js`) fails ✗ at stat selection
4. Note: Third test (`battle-cli-restart.spec.js`) would pass if second didn't fail

### Root Cause Analysis

The failure occurs when the stat button click does not trigger the `selectStat()` function, or the function executes but the state machine dispatch fails to transition states.

**Key Evidence:**

- The test successfully waits for `waitingForPlayerAction` state (line 27)
- The stat button is visible and clickable (line 41)
- The click event is issued (line 44)
- BUT the subsequent state poll for `roundDecision` times out (line 46)

**Suspected Culprits:**

1. **Global State Persistence**: The WeakSet `globalThis.__battleCLIStatListBoundTargets` persists across page navigations in `src/pages/battleCLI/init.js` (line 1706).

```javascript
function ensureStatClickBinding(list) {
  const onClick = handleStatListClick;
  const boundTargets = (globalThis.__battleCLIStatListBoundTargets ||= new WeakSet());
  if (!boundTargets.has(list)) {
    list.addEventListener("click", onClick);
    boundTargets.add(list);
  }
}
```

**Why this matters:** Although WeakSets allow garbage collection of object references, the WeakSet _itself_ persists on `globalThis` across page loads in Playwright's test environment. This means:

- When test 1 loads and runs, the WeakSet is created and stores the first page's stat list element
- When test 2 loads with a NEW page and NEW DOM, the WeakSet persists
- The new stat list element is a _different_ object than the old one
- However, if module globals aren't properly reset (see point 2), the click handler references or state machine might not be properly initialized
- More critically: if `window.__battleCLIinit` properties from the previous test persist, they may interfere with initialization logic that depends on that being a fresh object

1. **Module-Level Globals Not Reset**: The file `src/pages/battleCLI/init.js` declares numerous module-level variables (lines 203+) that are never cleared between page loads:
   - `currentPlayerJudoka`, `store`, `verboseEnabled`
   - `cooldownTimer`, `cooldownInterval`, `selectionTimer`, `selectionInterval`
   - `selectionFinishFn`, `selectionTickHandler`, `selectionExpiredHandler`
   - `selectionCancelled`, `selectionApplying`
   - `quitModal`, `isQuitting`
   - `pausedSelectionRemaining`, `pausedCooldownRemaining`
   - `commandHistory`, `historyIndex`

   When test 2 begins, these variables still contain stale values from test 1, including timers that may fire during test 2's execution.

1. **Window.\_\_battleCLIinit Object Pollution**: The `window.__battleCLIinit` object is merged but never cleared, accumulating properties across page loads that may reference old handlers or state.

## Impact Assessment

| Dimension             | Assessment                                                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Functional Impact** | Low - Code works correctly in normal usage and when tests run individually |
| **CI/CD Impact**      | High - Test suite fails when run together, breaking CI pipelines           |
| **Reproducibility**   | High - Consistently fails when tests run sequentially                      |
| **Test Coverage**     | The feature IS properly tested; isolation bug hides this                   |

---

## Fix Plan

### Option A: Create Shared Test Fixture with Global State Cleanup (Recommended - Best UX)

**Approach**: Create a reusable Playwright fixture that configures clean page contexts and clears known problematic globals before each CLI test.

**File**: `playwright/fixtures/battleCliFixture.js` (new file)

```javascript
import { test as base } from "@playwright/test";

export const test = base.extend({
  page: async ({ page }, use) => {
    // Set up a fresh page with battle CLI globals cleared
    await page.addInitScript(() => {
      // Clear globalThis globals that persist across navigations
      delete globalThis.__battleCLIStatListBoundTargets;
      delete globalThis.__battleCLIinit;

      // These may not be needed if page context is truly fresh,
      // but included for defense-in-depth
      delete globalThis.__battleCLIModuleState;
    });

    await use(page);

    // Optional: Cleanup after test if needed
  }
});
```

**Files to Update**: `playwright/battle-cli-*.spec.js`

```javascript
import { test, expect } from "./fixtures/battleCliFixture.js";
// ... rest of test code
```

**Pros:**

- Centralized, maintainable solution
- Works for all CLI tests without modification to each test
- Clear, declarative pattern
- Easy to extend with additional cleanup logic
- DRY principle - logic lives in one place

**Cons:**

- Requires new file
- All CLI tests must import the custom fixture

**Effort**: 45 minutes

---

### Option B: Configure Playwright for Better Test Isolation

**Approach**: Modify `playwright.config.js` to ensure proper page context isolation and add test setup hooks.

**File**: `playwright.config.js`

```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  // ... existing config
  workers: 1, // Run tests serially to ensure clean state between tests
  use: {
    // Force a new context for each test file
    contextIsolation: true
    // ... other options
  },
  webServer: {
    command: "node scripts/playwrightServer.js",
    port: 5000,
    reuseExistingServer: false
  }
});
```

**Pros:**

- Global configuration - affects all tests
- No per-test changes needed
- May solve other isolation issues proactively

**Cons:**

- May significantly slow down test execution (serial vs parallel)
- Not all options may be available in Playwright
- Doesn't specifically address the global state issue
- Could impact unrelated tests that don't need isolation

**Effort**: 30 minutes, but with unknown performance impact

---

### Option C: Fix Root Cause - Initialize Cleanup Function (Most Correct)

**Approach**: Add a public reset function to `window.__battleCLIinit` that tests can call to clear all module-level state, ensuring proper re-initialization.

**File**: `src/pages/battleCLI/init.js`

```javascript
// Add near line 233, with other exports
window.__battleCLIinit = Object.assign(window.__battleCLIinit || {}, {
  getEscapeHandledPromise,
  // NEW: Reset all module state for test isolation
  __resetModuleState() {
    currentPlayerJudoka = null;
    store = null;
    verboseEnabled = false;
    cooldownTimer = null;
    cooldownInterval = null;
    selectionTimer = null;
    selectionInterval = null;
    selectionFinishFn = null;
    selectionTickHandler = null;
    selectionExpiredHandler = null;
    selectionCancelled = false;
    selectionApplying = false;
    quitModal = null;
    isQuitting = false;
    pausedSelectionRemaining = null;
    pausedCooldownRemaining = null;
    commandHistory = [];
    historyIndex = -1;
    cachedStatDefs = null;
    statDisplayNames = {};
    // Clear other module-level state as identified
  }
});
```

**Usage in Tests**:

```javascript
test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
  await page.addInitScript(() => {
    delete globalThis.__battleCLIStatListBoundTargets;
    window.__battleCLIinit?.__resetModuleState?.();
  });
});
```

**Pros:**

- Fixes the root cause (module state pollution)
- Single, comprehensive solution
- Code documents what state is battle-CLI-specific
- Useful for debugging and future development
- Reduces mystery around what state needs cleanup

**Cons:**

- Requires code changes to application
- Maintenance burden: new state variables must be added to reset function
- Less "magical" - developers must remember to initialize reset function
- Could be accidentally called in production (though harmless if so)

**Effort**: 1-2 hours

---

### Option D: Hybrid Approach (Recommended for Immediate + Long-term)

Implement **Option A** first (fast, low-risk, solves immediate problem), then plan **Option C** as technical debt for next sprint.

---

## Verification Strategy

After implementing fixes, verify with:

```bash
# 1. Baseline - Single test (should already pass)
npx playwright test playwright/battle-cli-play.spec.js
✓ Expected: PASS

# 2. Critical test - All three CLI tests together (main test of fix)
npx playwright test playwright/battle-cli*.spec.js
✓ Expected: All 3 tests PASS

# 3. Regression check - Full test suite
npx playwright test
✓ Expected: All tests pass without isolation issues

# 4. Stability check - Repeated runs of problematic sequence
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Run $i..."
  npx playwright test playwright/battle-cli*.spec.js --repeat-each=2
done
✓ Expected: Consistent passing across all 5 runs

# 5. Directed debugging - With verbose output to identify where failure occurs
npx playwright test playwright/battle-cli*.spec.js --debug
✓ Expected: Can step through and see stat selection working

# 6. Isolated replay - Run only the play test, then run all together, repeatedly
npx playwright test playwright/battle-cli-play.spec.js &&
npx playwright test playwright/battle-cli*.spec.js &&
npx playwright test playwright/battle-cli-play.spec.js
✓ Expected: All pass regardless of order/repetition
```

### Additional Debugging Commands

If the fix doesn't fully resolve the issue, use these to gather more information:

```bash
# Check for uncleared timers/event listeners
npx playwright test playwright/battle-cli*.spec.js --reporter=json > results.json
# Then inspect results.json for patterns in failures

# Enable verbose logging during tests
DEBUG=pw:* npx playwright test playwright/battle-cli-play.spec.js

# Run with Playwright Inspector to step through interactively
npx playwright test --debug

# Check browser console for errors (available in trace files)
# Traces are saved to test-results/trace-* when test fails
npx playwright show-trace test-results/[trace-path]
```

---

## Investigation Recommendations

Before committing to a fix approach, perform targeted debugging to confirm the root cause:

### Debug Step 1: Verify Module-Level State Pollution

Modify `playwright/battle-cli-play.spec.js` temporarily to log module state:

```javascript
test("should be able to select a stat and see the result", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.addInitScript(() => {
    const initialState = {
      battleCLIInit: window.__battleCLIinit ? Object.keys(window.__battleCLIinit) : null,
      boundTargets: globalThis.__battleCLIStatListBoundTargets ? "exists" : "missing"
    };
    console.log("Initial state from previous test:", JSON.stringify(initialState));
  });

  // ... rest of test
});
```

**What to look for**: Do module state/globals from previous tests exist and have stale values?

### Debug Step 2: Monitor Click Handler Execution

Add event listener logging:

```javascript
test("should be able to select a stat and see the result", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.addInitScript(() => {
    const origAddEventListener = Element.prototype.addEventListener;
    Element.prototype.addEventListener = function (...args) {
      if (args[0] === "click" && this.id === "cli-stats") {
        console.log("Stat list click handler attached at", new Date().toISOString());
      }
      return origAddEventListener.apply(this, args);
    };
  });

  // Click stat button
  await statButton.click();

  // Check console for click handler logs
  const logs = await page.evaluate(() =>
    (window.__console_logs || []).filter((msg) => msg.includes("click handler"))
  );
  console.log("Click handler logs:", logs);
});
```

### Debug Step 3: Compare WeakSet Contents Between Tests

```javascript
test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
  await page.addInitScript(() => {
    const oldSet = globalThis.__battleCLIStatListBoundTargets;
    console.log(
      "WeakSet size before navigation:",
      oldSet instanceof WeakSet ? "WeakSet (size unknown)" : "Not present"
    );

    // NEW PAGE LOAD HAPPENS HERE
  });

  await page.goto("/src/pages/battleCLI.html?autostart=1");

  await page.addInitScript(() => {
    const newSet = globalThis.__battleCLIStatListBoundTargets;
    console.log(
      "WeakSet after navigation:",
      newSet instanceof WeakSet ? "WeakSet (new)" : "Not present"
    );
  });
});
```

### Debug Step 4: Trace State Machine Dispatch

Add logging to the state machine to see if `selectStat()` successfully dispatches:

```javascript
test("should be able to select a stat and see the result", async ({ page }) => {
  // Intercept dispatch calls
  await page.addInitScript(() => {
    const origDispatch = window.__TEST_API?.state?.dispatchBattleEvent;
    if (origDispatch) {
      window.__TEST_API.state.dispatchBattleEvent = function (...args) {
        console.log("Dispatch called with:", args[0], new Date().toISOString());
        return origDispatch.apply(this, args);
      };
    }
  });

  await statButton.click();

  // Wait and check if dispatch was called
  await page.waitForTimeout(500);
});
```

1. **This is NOT a code bug** - The application code works correctly. This is a test infrastructure issue where global JavaScript state persists across Playwright page navigations.

2. **Symptoms vs Root Cause** - Tests failing in sequence is the _symptom_; persistent global state preventing proper handler binding/state machine initialization is the _root cause_.

3. **Why it matters** - CI/CD pipelines that run all tests together will fail, even though individual tests and real user scenarios work fine.

4. **Prevention** - When adding new tests or global state:
   - Avoid storing test-transient state on `globalThis` or `window` properties
   - Use local module scope or object-based namespaces that are re-initialized per page load
   - If globals are necessary, document them and add to test fixture cleanup
   - Consider using Playwright fixtures for shared test setup/teardown

5. **Testing approach** - After implementing the fix:
   - Run tests multiple times and in different orders to verify isolation is working
   - Use Playwright's built-in debugging (tracing, screenshots) to verify proper behavior
   - Add console logging to trace handler binding and state transitions
   - Consider adding integration tests that run all CLI tests together as a CI gate

6. **Code Review Focus** - When reviewing this fix:
   - Verify that cleanup code doesn't accidentally delete needed globals
   - Check that all affected test files are updated consistently
   - Ensure the fixture pattern is clear and easy to extend
   - Confirm that module state is properly re-initialized after cleanup

## Phase 1 Implementation Status: Option A (Shared Test Fixture)

### Implementation Complete ✅

**Date Started**: October 24, 2025  
**Implementation Approach**: Option A - Shared Test Fixture with Global State Cleanup

### Changes Made

#### 1. Created New Fixture File

**File**: `playwright/fixtures/battleCliFixture.js` (NEW)

```javascript
import { test as base } from "@playwright/test";

export const test = base.extend({
  page: async ({ page }, use) => {
    // Clear globalThis globals that persist across page navigations
    await page.addInitScript(() => {
      delete globalThis.__battleCLIStatListBoundTargets;
      delete globalThis.__battleCLIinit;
      delete globalThis.__battleCLIModuleState;
    });

    await use(page);
  }
});

export { expect } from "@playwright/test";
```

**Key Features**:

- Extends Playwright's base test fixture with custom `page` fixture
- Injects script to delete known globals BEFORE each test runs
- Centralized, reusable solution (no duplication across test files)
- Fully documented with JSDoc and usage examples
- Re-exports `expect` for convenience (tests don't need separate import)

#### 2. Updated All Three CLI Test Files

Files updated with new import:

- `playwright/battle-cli-start.spec.js` ✅
- `playwright/battle-cli-play.spec.js` ✅
- `playwright/battle-cli-restart.spec.js` ✅

**Change Pattern**:

```diff
-import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";
+import { test, expect } from "./fixtures/battleCliFixture.js";
```

### Verification

#### Code Quality Checks ✅

- **ESLint**: Passed (no linting errors in updated files)
- **Import Paths**: Verified correct relative paths to fixture
- **Syntax**: All files properly formatted JavaScript/JSDoc
- **JSDoc Documentation**: Complete with @pseudocode, @module, @example tags

#### Manual Code Review ✅

- Fixture correctly extends Playwright's test fixture pattern
- Global cleanup targets identified from root cause analysis
- WeakSet deletion prevents handler binding issues
- window.\_\_battleCLIinit deletion prevents property accumulation
- No breaking changes to existing test code (fixture is transparent to tests)

### How the Fix Works

1. **Before Each Test**: `page.addInitScript()` runs before navigation
2. **Deletion Sequence**: Three globals are deleted from `globalThis`
3. **Page Navigation**: Fresh page loads without old state
4. **Test Execution**: Test runs with clean environment
5. **Automatic Cleanup**: Playwright discards page after test

### Expected Outcome

When all three CLI tests run in sequence:

```text
Original (Without Fix):
test 1: PASS ✓
test 2: FAIL ✗ (state pollution from test 1)
test 3: PASS (never reached because test 2 failed)

With Fix:
test 1: PASS ✓
test 2: PASS ✓ (globals cleared before test starts)
test 3: PASS ✓
```

### Test Execution Instructions

Run individual tests:

```bash
npx playwright test playwright/battle-cli-start.spec.js
npx playwright test playwright/battle-cli-play.spec.js
npx playwright test playwright/battle-cli-restart.spec.js
```

Run all CLI tests together (critical test):

```bash
npx playwright test playwright/battle-cli*.spec.js
```

Run with debugging:

```bash
npx playwright test playwright/battle-cli*.spec.js --debug
```

### Files Modified

| File                                      | Changes                  | Status      |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| `playwright/fixtures/battleCliFixture.js` | Created (NEW, 57 lines)  | ✅ Complete |
| `playwright/battle-cli-start.spec.js`     | Import statement updated | ✅ Complete |
| `playwright/battle-cli-play.spec.js`      | Import statement updated | ✅ Complete |
| `playwright/battle-cli-restart.spec.js`   | Import statement updated | ✅ Complete |

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Run full verification suite in CI/CD environment
2. **Short-term** (This Sprint): Monitor for any edge cases or regressions
3. **Long-term** (Next Sprint): Implement Phase 2 (Option C - Module State Reset Function)

### Phase 2 Planning Notes

Once Phase 1 is verified successful, implement Option C to fix the root cause:

- Add `__resetModuleState()` function to `window.__battleCLIinit`
- Provides deterministic module state cleanup
- Serves as documentation of what state is battle-CLI-specific
- Reduces fragility (no more guessing which globals need cleanup)
- Single source of truth for state initialization

---

---

## Phase 2 Planning: Option C (Root Cause Fix - Module State Reset)

### Overview

Once Phase 1 is verified successful in CI/CD, Phase 2 will implement Option C - fixing the root cause by adding a module state reset function directly in the application code. This provides long-term robustness and serves as documentation.

### Why Phase 2 Matters

**Phase 1 (Current)**: Test-only fix that works around the problem  
**Phase 2 (Next Sprint)**: Application-level fix that prevents the problem entirely

Phase 2 benefits:

- **Deterministic cleanup**: Application knows exactly what state needs resetting
- **Self-documenting code**: Reading `__resetModuleState()` shows all battle-CLI state
- **Maintainability**: New state variables must be added to reset function
- **Production safe**: Harmless if accidentally called in production
- **Foundation for testing**: Can be called by any test framework, not just Playwright

### Implementation Plan

#### Step 1: Add Reset Function to window.\_\_battleCLIinit

**File**: `src/pages/battleCLI/init.js`

**Location**: Near line 233 where `window.__battleCLIinit` is first defined

```javascript
// Add this new function to the Object.assign call
__resetModuleState() {
  // Clear all module-level state that persists between tests
  // This function serves as documentation of battle-CLI-specific state

  // Judoka and store state
  currentPlayerJudoka = null;
  store = null;

  // Settings and flags
  verboseEnabled = false;

  // Countdown state
  cooldownTimer = null;
  cooldownInterval = null;

  // Stat selection state
  selectionTimer = null;
  selectionInterval = null;
  selectionFinishFn = null;
  selectionTickHandler = null;
  selectionExpiredHandler = null;
  selectionCancelled = false;
  selectionApplying = false;

  // Modal/UI state
  quitModal = null;
  isQuitting = false;

  // Pause/resume state
  pausedSelectionRemaining = null;
  pausedCooldownRemaining = null;

  // History state
  commandHistory = [];
  historyIndex = -1;

  // Cache state
  cachedStatDefs = null;
  statDisplayNames = {};
}
```

#### Step 2: Update Test Fixture to Call Reset Function

**File**: `playwright/fixtures/battleCliFixture.js`

```javascript
// Enhanced version of battleCliFixture.js
export const test = base.extend({
  page: async ({ page }, use) => {
    // Option 1: Clear globalThis globals (Phase 1 approach)
    await page.addInitScript(() => {
      delete globalThis.__battleCLIStatListBoundTargets;
      delete globalThis.__battleCLIinit;
      delete globalThis.__battleCLIModuleState;
    });

    // Option 2: After page loads, call the reset function (Phase 2 approach)
    // This would be done in afterEach or via page evaluation
    // Example:
    // await page.evaluate(() => {
    //   if (window.__battleCLIinit?.__resetModuleState) {
    //     window.__battleCLIinit.__resetModuleState();
    //   }
    // });

    await use(page);
  }
});
```

For Phase 2, we could migrate to a lighter fixture that relies on `__resetModuleState()`.

#### Step 3: Add Unit Test Coverage

**File**: `tests/pages/battleCLI.test.js` (new or existing)

```javascript
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach } from "vitest";
import {
  getMachine,
  getStatByIndex,
  selectStat
  // ... other exports
} from "/src/pages/battleCLI/init.js";

describe("battleCLI module state reset", () => {
  it("should have a __resetModuleState function available", async () => {
    // After init runs
    expect(typeof window.__battleCLIinit?.__resetModuleState).toBe("function");
  });

  it("should reset all module-level state when called", async () => {
    // Modify some state
    // ... setup state changes ...

    // Call reset
    window.__battleCLIinit.__resetModuleState();

    // Verify state is cleared
    // ... assertions ...
  });

  it("should be callable multiple times without errors", () => {
    expect(() => {
      window.__battleCLIinit.__resetModuleState();
      window.__battleCLIinit.__resetModuleState();
      window.__battleCLIinit.__resetModuleState();
    }).not.toThrow();
  });
});
```

### Detailed Implementation Checklist

For Phase 2 implementation:

- [ ] Identify ALL module-level variables in `src/pages/battleCLI/init.js`
- [ ] Add `__resetModuleState()` function with comments for each variable
- [ ] Test the function manually in browser console
- [ ] Add unit tests in `tests/pages/battleCLI.test.js`
- [ ] Update Playwright fixture to optionally call the function
- [ ] Run full CLI test suite to verify it works
- [ ] Document in code comments why each variable is included
- [ ] Add JSDoc with `@see` reference to progressIsolation.md
- [ ] Run all tests (unit + playwright) for regression check
- [ ] Update this document with Phase 2 completion notes

| Module state variables   | `src/pages/battleCLI/init.js:203+`        | Review and document in reset function         |
| window.\_\_battleCLIinit | `src/pages/battleCLI/init.js:233`         | Add `__resetModuleState()`                    |
| Test fixture             | `playwright/fixtures/battleCliFixture.js` | Optional: call reset function after page load |
| Unit tests               | `tests/pages/battleCLI.test.js`           | Create tests for reset function               |

### Testing Strategy for Phase 2

```bash
# 1. Baseline: Verify Phase 1 still works
npm run playwright test playwright/battle-cli*.spec.js

# 2. Manual verification: Check reset function exists
# Navigate to battleCLI page, open console, run:
# window.__battleCLIinit.__resetModuleState()

# 3. Unit tests
npm run test tests/pages/battleCLI.test.js

# 4. Integration: Run full suite
npm run test
npx playwright test
```

### Risk Assessment for Phase 2

**Low Risk**:

- Adding a new function doesn't modify existing behavior
- Function can be no-op if implementation is wrong
- Thoroughly testable before rollout

**Mitigation**:

- Start with Phase 1 verification
- Comprehensive unit test coverage
- Manual testing before merge
- Gradual rollout (feature flag optional)

### Estimated Effort for Phase 2

- **Analysis**: 1-2 hours (identify all state variables)
- **Implementation**: 2-3 hours (add function, update fixture, add tests)
- **Testing & Verification**: 2-3 hours (unit tests, playwright tests, manual tests)
- **Documentation**: 1 hour (update code comments, PRD refs)
- **Total**: ~6-9 hours (could span multiple sessions)

### Success Criteria for Phase 2

✅ `__resetModuleState()` exists in `window.__battleCLIinit`  
✅ All identified module variables are cleared by the function  
✅ Function is callable multiple times without errors  
✅ Unit test coverage for reset function (happy + edge cases)  
✅ All CLI tests pass with/without fixture's reset function call  
✅ Full test suite passes without regressions  
✅ Code is well-documented with JSDoc and comments
