| **Country flag picker becomes unusable after horizontal scroll** | 1. Click the **Country filter** toggle (first red icon).  2. When the slide‑out panel appears, use a horizontal scroll gesture (mouse‑wheel left/right) on the flag row.  3. The flag row disappears, leaving an empty panel. There is no way to scroll back, so no flags are selectable. | Users can accidentally hide the country selector and cannot filter by country. The panel becomes blank, so players cannot pick or change countries.                |
| **Selecting a flag does not filter the roster**                  | 1. Open the country panel.  2. Click any flag (e.g., the Portugal flag).  3. The panel briefly shows a larger version of the clicked flag, but the card carousel does not update; all judoka remain visible.                                                                              | Filtering appears non‑functional, preventing players from narrowing the roster by country. This fails acceptance criteria requiring country filter to limit cards. |
| **Card stats require vertical scrolling**                        | Each card container includes its own vertical scroll bar. On desktop at 1024 px width, users must scroll within a card to see the bottom of the stats section. The PRD states that judoka cards should “display all stats without scrolling on common desktop resolutions”.               | Usability & accessibility issue; players may not realize additional stats exist below the fold.                                                                    |
| **Center card not clearly enlarged**                             | The PRD specifies that the focused (center) card should be enlarged by ~10%. In the current build, the enlargement on focus/hover is subtle and almost imperceptible.                                                                                                                     | The intended “binder‑like” feeling and focus cue are lost, reducing visual polish and accessibility.                                                               |
| **Page marker highlight difficult to interpret**                 | The page markers below the carousel are tiny dots with only a slight color change. They do not announce updates via an `aria-live` region as required.                                                                                                                                    | Screen‑reader users may not get feedback about their position in the carousel, and sighted players may have difficulty seeing which page is active.                |
| **Country flags not obviously alphabetized**                     | The flag row shows countries in an order that does not match alphabetical sorting (e.g., Suriname, Georgia, Jamaica, Portugal appear together). The PRD mandates alphabetical ordering.                                                                                                   | Inconsistent ordering makes it harder for players to find their country and conflicts with the acceptance criteria.                                                |
| **Tooltip and icons on small screens**                           | The panel toggle, clear filter and navigation buttons appear small (~24 px). The PRD calls for a minimum tap‑target size of 44×44 px.                                                                                                                                                     | Touch users may find it difficult to tap the small icons accurately.                                                                                               |
| **No visible error handling**                                    | Disconnecting from the network during testing did not show an “Unable to load roster” message or retry button, though the PRD specifies this for network failures.                                                                                                                        | Players experiencing connectivity issues might see a blank screen without guidance.                                                                                |
| **Keyboard closing of country panel not evident**                | The panel does not indicate that pressing `Escape` closes it; only clicking the toggle hides it. This diverges from the requirement that the panel support closing via Escape.                                                                                                            | Keyboard‑only users may struggle to dismiss the panel once opened.                                                                                                 |

Improvement opportunities
Fix the country picker slider: Prevent horizontal scroll from removing the flag row; ensure the list snaps back or allows scrolling back. Consider adding arrow buttons for navigation. When a flag is selected, filter the carousel immediately and display an empty‑state message (“No judoka available for this country”) when appropriate.
Alphabetical ordering & grouping: Generate the country list using localeCompare as described in the PRD. Provide a labelled search or quick‑jump to improve usability for players with many countries.
Improve tap target size and contrast: Increase the size of the filter toggle, clear filter and navigation arrows to meet the 44 × 44 px guideline. Check color contrast of text and backgrounds to meet WCAG 2.1 AA.
Card layout without vertical scroll: Adjust card dimensions or reduce padding so that all stats are visible without internal scrolling on typical desktop resolutions. On smaller screens, consider collapsing less important stats or using a responsive stacking layout.
Clear enlargement effect: Enhance the scaling animation for the centered card so that it is visibly larger (~10%) when focused, aligning with the “binder” effect described in the PRD. Use CSS transitions for smoothness.
Accessible page markers: Increase the size and contrast of page markers. Associate them with an aria-live region so that screen readers announce “Page 2 of 5” when navigation occurs.
Keyboard & screen reader support: Allow the country panel to be opened/closed via Enter/Space and dismissed with Escape. Ensure focus moves into the panel when it opens, with logical tab order through flags and the clear‑filter button.
Performance & offline handling: Implement lazy‑loading of card images and data if the roster grows to 100+ entries. Display a loading spinner and show the specified “Unable to load roster” error with a retry button on network failure.
Automation hooks: Expose data‑testids for carousel pages, flag items and error states to facilitate Playwright/UI tests. Tests should verify focus transitions, filter logic, and retry flows.
UX polish: Add subtle ripple or scaling feedback on tapping buttons; ensure transitions (e.g., opening/closing the panel) are smooth. Provide persistent memory of the last selected country when returning to the page.
