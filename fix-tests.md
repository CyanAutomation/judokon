# Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Found

1. **Score updates not happening**: The battle engine is not properly initialized in test environments, causing the `evaluateRound` function to fall back to a simple implementation that doesn't maintain cumulative scores.

2. **Round messages not displayed**: The round resolution process is not properly emitting events or updating the UI elements.

## Root Cause

The `evaluateRound` function in `battleUI.js` was using a fallback implementation that always returned scores of 0 or 1, rather than cumulative scores. Additionally, the battle engine facade was not properly handling the case where the engine is not initialized.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed evaluateRound function**: Updated to use the battle engine facade properly and handle fallback cases correctly.

2. **Fixed evaluateOutcome function**: Added proper error handling for when the battle engine is not initialized.

3. **Ensured proper score tracking**: The fallback implementation now maintains cumulative scores.
