## Project Structure

JU-DO-KON! is a browser-based card game. The repository includes HTML pages, JavaScript modules and CSS styling, with JSON data for judoka information and game content. Development standards are documented in the design/ directory.

index.html – main landing page with links to other modes.
game.js – client-side logic for loading data, generating cards and handling carousel interactions.
helpers/ – modular utilities for building cards, navigation and data access. Functions use extensive JSDoc with @pseudocode blocks. Example from utils.js
pages/ – additional screens like random card, card carousel or quote viewer; each page loads modules dynamically
data/ – JSON files (e.g., judoka.json, gokyo.json, gameModes.json) containing game assets and configuration.
tests/ – unit tests run with Vitest. Configuration uses jsdom environment. Example tests cover utilities and UI helpers.
Development standards

The repository specifies commenting standards in design/codeStandards. JSDoc comments and @pseudocode blocks must remain intact, as shown in documentation excerpts.

## 🎮 How to Play JUDOKON!

**JUDOKON!** is a fast-paced, Top Trumps-style card game featuring real-life elite judoka. You play against the computer in a battle of stats — first to 10 wins takes the match!

### 🥋 The Rules:

1. **You vs. Computer**

   - Each match starts with both players receiving **25 random cards** from a 99-card deck.

2. **Start the Battle**

   - In each round, you and the computer each draw your top card.

3. **Choose Your Stat**

   - You select one of the stats on your card (e.g. Power, Speed, Technique, etc.)

4. **Compare Stats**

   - The chosen stat is compared with the computer’s card.
   - **Highest value wins the round**.
   - If both stats are equal, it’s a **draw** — no one scores.

5. **Scoring**

   - Each round win gives you **1 point**.
   - The cards used in that round are **discarded** (not reused).

6. **Winning the Match**
   - First player to reach **10 points** wins!
   - If **neither player reaches 10 points after 25 rounds**, the match ends in a **draw**.
