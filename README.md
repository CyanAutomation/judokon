## Quick Start

1. Make sure you have **Node 18+** and `npm` (or another package manager) installed.
2. Clone the repository, install dependencies, and launch the development server:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cyanautomation/judokon.git
   cd judokon
   npm install
   npm start  # lightweight local dev server
   # Then visit: http://localhost:5000
   ```
3. Verify formatting and linting before committing:

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

   **For UI-related changes**, also verify color contrast. Make sure a local server (for example `npm start`) is running so Pa11y can access http://localhost:5000:

   ```bash
   npm run check:contrast  # runs Pa11y against http://localhost:5000
   ```

### Debug Logging

To see verbose output from the helper modules during development, enable the
`DEBUG_LOGGING` flag:

```bash
# Node/CLI
DEBUG_LOGGING=true npx vitest run
```

In the browser you can enable it from the console before loading the page:

```javascript
window.DEBUG_LOGGING = true;
```

## Screenshot Tests (On-Demand)

Run optional Playwright-based screenshot tests with:

```bash
npm run test:screenshot
```

Set `SKIP_SCREENSHOTS=true` to skip the screenshot suite if you only want to run
the other Playwright tests:

```bash
SKIP_SCREENSHOTS=true npm run test:screenshot
```

## Project Structure

The repository follows a simple layout. GitHub Pages requires `index.html` to live at the project root.

- `index.html` â€“ landing page served by GitHub Pages. Internal navigation links
  use relative paths (e.g., `../../index.html`) so the site can be served from
  any base URL.
- `src/` â€“ contains the game logic and assets:
  - `game.js`
  - `helpers/`
  - `components/` â€“ small DOM factories like `Button`, `ToggleSwitch`, the `Modal` dialog, and `StatsPanel`
    ```javascript
    import { createStatsPanel } from "./src/components/StatsPanel.js";
    const panel = createStatsPanel({ power: 9, speed: 8, technique: 7 });
    document.body.appendChild(panel);
    ```
  - `pages/`
    HTML pages. Each page imports a matching module from
    `src/helpers` (for example `randomJudokaPage.js`) that wires up its
    interactive behavior.
  - `data/`
  - `schemas/`  
    JSON Schema definitions used to validate the data files.
  - `assets/`
  - `styles/`
- `tests/` â€“ Vitest unit tests.
- `design/` â€“ documentation and code standards.
- [Architecture Overview](design/architecture.md) â€“ summary of key modules.

### CSS Organization

- `base.css` â€“ tokens, resets, and global typography.
- `layout.css` â€“ overall page layout/grid.
- `components.css` â€“ reusable UI components.
- `utilities.css` â€“ helper classes.
- Page-specific files such as `carousel.css` and `quote.css`.

Import styles in this order: `base.css` first, then layout and component files, and finally `utilities.css`.

Global rules should not be repeated across files.

All pages include a fixed header and persistent bottom navigation bar. The body has top and bottom padding to ensure content scrolls under these elements.

The `.animate-card` class in `components.css` reveals new cards with a short
fade and upward slide. A `prefers-reduced-motion` media query removes the
animation so the card appears instantly when motion reduction is requested.

## Data Schemas and Validation

JSON files in `src/data` are validated against matching schemas in `src/schemas`.
Validate all data files at once with the npm script (which runs `scripts/validateData.js`):

```bash
npm run validate:data
```

You can also validate a single pair manually:

```bash
npx ajv validate -s src/schemas/judoka.schema.json -d src/data/judoka.json
```

See [design/dataSchemas/README.md](design/dataSchemas/README.md) for full details
and instructions on updating schemas when data changes.

The repository specifies commenting standards in design/codeStandards. JSDoc comments and @pseudocode blocks must remain intact, as shown in documentation excerpts.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play JUDOKON!

**JUDOKON!** is a fast-paced, Top Trumps-style card game featuring real-life elite judoka. You play against the computer in a battle of stats â€” first to 10 wins takes the match!

### ðŸ¥‹ The Rules:

1. **You vs. Computer**
   - Each match starts with both players receiving **25 random cards** from a 99-card deck.

2. **Start the Battle**
   - In each round, you and the computer each draw your top card.

3. **Choose Your Stat**
   - You select one of the stats on your card (e.g. Power, Speed, Technique, etc.)

4. **Compare Stats**
   - The chosen stat is compared with the computerâ€™s card.
   - **Highest value wins the round**.
   - If both stats are equal, itâ€™s a **draw** â€” no one scores.

5. **Scoring**
   - Each round win gives you **1 point**.
   - The cards used in that round are **discarded** (not reused).

6. **Winning the Match**
   - First player to reach **10 points** wins!
   - If **neither player reaches 10 points after 25 rounds**, the match ends in a **draw**.

## Live Demo

Try the game live in your browser: [JU-DO-KON!](https://cyanautomation.github.io/judokon/)

- No installation required.
- Fully playable with all features.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the game.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For game logic and interactivity.
- **Vite**: For building and bundling the project.
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting the live demo.

## Known Issues

- The game currently does not support mobile devices.
- Animations for card flips are not yet implemented.
- Difficulty levels for the computer opponent are under development.

## Display Modes

JU-DO-KON! supports **light**, **dark**, and **gray** themes. The
`applyDisplayMode` helper sets a `data-theme` attribute on the `<body>` element
so CSS in `src/styles/base.css` can override variables for each mode. Define a
new theme by adding a `[data-theme="my-theme"]` block with your custom
variables and call `applyDisplayMode("my-theme")` to activate it.

If you modify theme colors, run `npm run check:contrast` while the development
server is running to verify adequate color contrast.

## Browser Compatibility

JU-DO-KON! is tested in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
The card carousel uses modern CSS like `clamp()` for flexible sizing. Safari 15
and older do not support `clamp()`, so cards fall back to a fixed `300px` width.
Safari may expand flex items if `min-width` isn't explicitly set. Set
`min-width: 0` on `.card-carousel` so horizontal scrolling works correctly.
Safari 18 has a regression where flex items grow when scroll buttons are inline
with the carousel. Apply `min-width: 0` to `.carousel-container` and position
`.scroll-button` absolutely to keep the carousel inside the viewport.
Another Safari quirk allows the placeholder `#carousel-container` element to
expand based on its children, producing a page wider than the viewport. Assign
`width: 100%`, `min-width: 0`, and `overflow: hidden` to `#carousel-container`
to constrain the carousel on this browser.
Mobile Safari supports smooth scrolling via
`-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`.
Safari may expand grid columns when the container width is undefined.
Setting `width: 100%` on both `.kodokan-grid` and `.kodokan-screen`
keeps the carousel from stretching beyond the viewport.
Safari counts scrollbars in the `vw` unit, which can lead to unexpected layout behavior. For example, a wrapper with `min-width: 100vw` may become wider than the page and cause horizontal scrolling. To prevent this, set `width: 100%` on the body and navbars. Optionally, use `overflow-x: hidden` to ensure the layout stays within the viewport.
Mobile Safari 18.5 may also add vertical scroll if fixed headers and footers use
`vh` units. The navbar height CSS variables now use `dvh` to match the dynamic
viewport height and avoid extra scrolling.

## Future Plans

- Get feedback on current cards and stat points
- Take submissions/suggestions on new card designs and stats
- Add animations for card flips and stat comparisons
- Implement difficulty levels for the computer opponent
- Expand the card deck with more judoka and stats

## Contributing

Please format your code with **Prettier**, lint it with **ESLint**, run **Vitest** and **Playwright** before submitting a pull request. For UI-related changes, also verify color contrast with `npm run check:contrast` (Pa11y) while the development server is running. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full checklist.
