## ðŸŽ® How to Play JUDOKON!

**JUDOKON!** is a fast-paced, Top Trumps-style card game featuring real-life elite judoka. You play against the computer in a battle of stats â€” first to 10 wins takes the match!

### ðŸ¥‹ The Rules:

1. **You vs. Computer**
   - Each match starts with both players receiving **25 random cards** from a 99-card deck.

2. **Start the Battle**
   - In each round, you and the computer each draw your top card.

3. **Choose Your Stat**
   - You select one of the stats on your card (e.g. Power, Speed, Technique, etc.)

4. **Compare Stats**
   - The chosen stat is compared with the computerâ€™s card.
   - **Highest value wins the round**.
   - If both stats are equal, itâ€™s a **draw** â€” no one scores.

5. **Scoring**
   - Each round win gives you **1 point**.
   - The cards used in that round are **discarded** (not reused).

6. **Winning the Match**
   - First player to reach **10 points** wins!
   - If **neither player reaches 10 points after 25 rounds**, the match ends in a **draw**.
