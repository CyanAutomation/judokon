# JU-DO-KON! ü•ã

**JU-DWhen you open `src/pages/battleJudoka.html`, a modal prompts you to choose the match length (win target) before the first round. For debugging or automated tests, append `?autostart=1` to skip the modal and begin immediately.

**Next button behavior:** The `Next` button advances only during inter-round cooldown, canceling any remaining cooldown. It remains disabled during stat selection to avoid accidental skips.* is a fast-paced, web-based card game, featuring real-life elite judoka. Designed for ages 8‚Äì12, the game uses simplified stats, vibrant collectible cards, and a player-vs-computer battle format. First to win 10 rounds takes the match!

## üìñ About the Game

JU-DO-KON! is a strategic digital card game inspired by Top Trumps, featuring judo athletes from around the world. Each card is assigned attributes like **Power**, **Technique**, **Speed**, and more‚Äîallowing players to battle judoka in quick, decisive rounds. The game is built using modern **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** and runs as a static site on GitHub Pages without any bundler.

### Classic Battle Start

When you open `src/pages/battleJudoka.html`, a modal prompts you to choose the match length (win target) before the first round. Options are sourced from `src/data/battleRounds.js`. Selecting an option sets the engine‚Äôs points-to-win and starts the pre-round countdown.

For debugging or automated tests, append `?autostart=1` to `battleJudoka.html` to skip the modal and begin a default-length match immediately.

Note on Next button behavior:

- The `Next` button advances only during the inter-round cooldown. Clicking it cancels any remaining cooldown and immediately starts the next round, regardless of the `skipRoundCooldown` setting.
- It remains disabled while choosing a stat to avoid skipping the cooldown logic accidentally. The cooldown enables `Next` (or auto-advances in test mode); do not expect `Next` to be ready during stat selection.

### Testing & Development Modes

For automated testing and debugging, the game supports specialized modes:

```js
import { setHeadlessMode } from "./src/helpers/headlessMode.js";
import { setTestMode } from "./src/helpers/testModeUtils.js";

setHeadlessMode(true); // zero delays for fast simulation
setTestMode(true); // deterministic RNG for consistent results
```

For complete testing configuration, debug panels, and CLI details, see **[docs/testing-modes.md](./docs/testing-modes.md)**.

## üîå Engine API

```js
import BattleEngine from "./src/helpers/BattleEngine.js";
import { renderMessage } from "./src/ui/renderMessage.js";

const engine = new BattleEngine({ pointsToWin: 3 });

const messages = {
  roundStarted: ({ round }) => `Round ${round} begins`,
  matchEnded: ({ outcome }) => `Match ${outcome}`,
};

engine.on("roundStarted", (data) => {
  renderMessage("#status", messages.roundStarted(data));
});

engine.on("matchEnded", (data) => {
  renderMessage("#status", messages.matchEnded(data));
});

engine.start();
```

`BattleEngine` contains only match logic. A mode subscribes to events and maps them to UI helpers like `renderMessage`, keeping presentation separate from engine code.

- [architecture.md](./architecture.md) for layout structure and observability models

---

## üß≠ Quickstart for AI Agents

### üîë Entry Points

- `/src/pages/settings.html` ‚Äì UI for toggling feature flags
- `/src/config/settingsDefaults.js` ‚Äì `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` source of truth for defaults
- `/data/tooltips.json` ‚Äì Tooltip content (auditable by agents)
- `/data/judoka.json` ‚Äì Card data for stat logic
- Typed data modules in `/src/data`: `battleRounds.js`, `gameTimers.js`, `navigationItems.js`, `statNames.js`, `japaneseConverter.js` ‚Äî export arrays with JSDoc type guarantees
- `/components/` ‚Äì Frontend logic with `data-*` hooks for observability

### üß™ Common Tasks

- ‚úÖ Check for missing tooltips on interactive elements
- ‚úÖ Validate stat blocks against rarity rules
- ‚úÖ Generate or evaluate PRDs for new features

Before committing code changes, run the full validation suite to verify docs, formatting, lint, tests, and contrast.
For the complete command reference and troubleshooting, see [docs/validation-commands.md](./docs/validation-commands.md).
For contributor-specific guidance, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Quick validation (essential checks):**

```bash
npm run check:jsdoc && npx prettier . --check && npx eslint . && npx vitest run && npx playwright test && npm run check:contrast
```

This suite includes a DOM regression test (`tests/pages/battleJudoka.dom.test.js`) that loads `battleJudoka.html` and fails if required IDs (`next-button`, `stat-help`, `quit-match-button`, `stat-buttons`) are missing.

### Classic Battle CLI

The project includes a terminal-style UI (`src/pages/battleCLI.html`) that reuses the Classic Battle engine with text-first controls:

- **Number keys [1‚Äì5]**: Select stats  
- **Enter/Space**: Advance rounds
- **Q**: Quit, **H**: Help panel

For complete CLI documentation, controls, and development details, see **[docs/battle-cli.md](./docs/battle-cli.md)**.

### Snackbar Container

Pages that display snackbars must include a persistent container:

```html
<div id="snackbar-container" role="status" aria-live="polite"></div>
```

Place this element **before** any script that may trigger snackbars to avoid duplicate IDs.

## APIs & Components

The game provides several APIs for development and integration:

- **Settings API**: `getSetting(key)` for cached settings, `isEnabled(flag)` for feature flags
- **Battle Engine**: Event-driven system with `roundStarted`, `roundEnded`, `matchEnded` events  
- **Display Modes**: Light, Dark, and Retro themes via `document.body.dataset.theme`

For complete API documentation, event schemas, and component usage, see **[docs/components.md](./docs/components.md)**.

## üîé Using the Vector RAG System

The project includes a high-performance vector RAG system with over 2,300 indexed chunks (2,328 currently) covering documentation, code standards, and game rules. Before scanning the repo for answers, use the [`queryRag`](./src/helpers/queryRag.js) helper:

```javascript
import queryRag from "./src/helpers/queryRag.js";
const matches = await queryRag("How does the battle engine work?");
```

**Command line usage:**

```bash
npm run rag:query "How does the battle engine work?"
```

**Performance:** 15x faster than manual exploration (2-second queries), with 62.5% accuracy for implementation queries and 95% for design docs.

For complete RAG system documentation, offline usage, evaluation tools, and advanced configuration, see **[docs/rag-system.md](./docs/rag-system.md)**.

## üì¥ Offline RAG Setup

Hydrate the embedding model for offline use with:

```bash
npm run rag:prepare:models -- --from-dir /path/to/minilm
```

Omit `--from-dir` when network access is available to download the model automatically. Once the model files are in place, validate the offline setup:

```bash
RAG_STRICT_OFFLINE=1 npm run rag:validate
```

If the model is missing, set `RAG_ALLOW_LEXICAL_FALLBACK=1` to allow a degraded lexical search until embeddings are hydrated.

## ‚ö° Module Loading Policy

Use static imports for hot paths and always-required modules; use dynamic imports with preload for optional or heavy features. See the canonical [Module Loading Policy for Agents](./AGENTS.md#module-loading-policy-for-agents) for the full policy.

## üß™ Testing

Run the complete test suite with:

```bash
npx vitest run          # Unit tests
npx playwright test     # Integration tests  
npm run test:style      # Style tests (on demand)
```

**Key features:**

- DOM regression testing for required UI elements
- Stable readiness patterns for Playwright (`window.battleReadyPromise`)
- Screenshot testing with update capabilities
- Skip button for fast-forwarding during debugging

For comprehensive testing strategies, Playwright patterns, and quality standards, see **[docs/testing-guide.md](./docs/testing-guide.md)**.

## üîÑ Updating Judoka Card Codes

### Stable readiness waits in Playwright

- Prefer `await page.evaluate(() => window.battleReadyPromise)` to detect that the Classic Battle page is fully initialized. This resolves when both the ‚Äúhome‚Äù and ‚Äústate‚Äù parts finish booting (see `src/helpers/battleInit.js`).
- Test helper shortcuts are available in `playwright/fixtures/waits.js`:
  - `await waitForBattleReady(page)` and `await waitForSettingsReady(page)`.
  - `await waitForBattleState(page, "waitingForPlayerAction", 10000)` for machine state assertions. This helper rejects if the state isn't reached within the provided timeout, preventing browser deadlocks.
  - `await page.evaluate(() => window.statButtonsReadyPromise)` to wait until stat buttons are re-enabled for a round.
- Avoid waiting for brittle UI states like the header timer element (`#next-round-timer`) to be visible at page load. The initial pre‚Äëmatch countdown is rendered via snackbar, not the header timer, and may be empty initially.
- When targeting round start readiness, it‚Äôs fine to wait for the selection prompt snackbar (e.g., ‚ÄúSelect your move‚Äù) or `#stat-buttons[data-buttons-ready="true"]`.

### Battle Debug Panel

When the `enableTestMode` feature flag is active, a debug panel appears above the player and opponent cards with live match data. The panel includes a **Copy** button that copies all text for easy sharing.

### Stat Hotkeys

Enable the `statHotkeys` feature flag to map number keys 1‚Äì5 to stat buttons for quicker selection. Disabled by default.
Invalid numeric keys now trigger a hint: "Use 1-5, press H for help".

Screenshot suites store their baseline images in `playwright/*-snapshots/`. To skip running these comparison tests locally, set the `SKIP_SCREENSHOTS` environment variable:

```bash
SKIP_SCREENSHOTS=true npx playwright test
```

When a UI change intentionally alters a screenshot, update the stored snapshots with:

```bash
npx playwright test --update-snapshots
```

## üîÑ Updating Judoka Card Codes

Run `npm run update:codes` whenever you add or edit judoka in `src/data/judoka.json`. The script regenerates the `cardCode` for each entry and falls back to the code from judoka `id=0` if generation fails.
