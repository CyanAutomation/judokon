## 📖 About the Game

JU-DO-KON! is a strategic digital card game inspired by Top Trumps, featuring judo athletes from around the world. Each card is assigned attributes like **Power**, **Technique**, **Speed**, and more—allowing players to battle judoka in quick, decisive rounds. The game is built using modern **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** and runs as a static site on GitHub Pages without any bundler.

### Classic Battle Start

When you open `src/pages/battleJudoka.html`, a modal prompts you to choose the match length (win target) before the first round. Options are sourced from `src/data/battleRounds.json` (fallbacks provided if loading fails). Selecting an option sets the engine’s points-to-win and starts the pre-round countdown.

For debugging or automated tests, append `?autostart=1` to `battleJudoka.html` to skip the modal and begin a default-length match immediately.

## 🚧 Development Status

The game is currently in active development. New features are being rolled out behind feature flags, with ongoing testing, design refinement, and gameplay enhancements.

## 👩‍💻 Contributing

Whether you're a developer, designer, tester, writer—or an AI agent—we welcome contributions to JU-DO-KON!

For full contribution guidelines, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## 🤖 AI Agent Compatibility

JU-DO-KON! welcomes structured, scoped contributions from AI agents. Agents are encouraged to help improve gameplay logic, design consistency, data integrity, and documentation.

Typical agent tasks include:

- Performing PRD evaluations and feature readiness checks
- Auditing tooltips and `data-*` observability hooks
- Validating feature flags and DOM compatibility
- Ensuring judoka stat data follows game rules

AI agents should begin by reading:

- [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for task guides and scope
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for commit conventions
- [architecture.md](./architecture.md) for layout structure and observability models

## 🧭 Quickstart for AI Agents

### 🔑 Entry Points

- `/src/pages/settings.html` – UI for toggling feature flags
- `/src/config/settingsDefaults.js` – `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` source of truth for defaults
- `/data/tooltips.json` – Tooltip content (auditable by agents)
- `/data/judoka.json` – Card data for stat logic
- `/components/` – Frontend logic with `data-*` hooks for observability

### 🧪 Common Tasks

- ✅ Check for missing tooltips on interactive elements
- ✅ Validate stat blocks against rarity rules
- ✅ Generate or evaluate PRDs for new features

### Snackbar Container

Pages that display snackbars must include a persistent container near the end of `<body>`:

```html
<div id="snackbar-container" role="status" aria-live="polite"></div>
```

`showSnackbar` and `updateSnackbar` reuse this element for notifications.

## Settings API

Settings are loaded once and cached for synchronous use. Default values come
from `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` in `src/config/settingsDefaults.js` and are overlaid
with any persisted values. Helpers in `src/helpers/settingsUtils.js` provide
safe access:

- `getSetting(key)` – read a setting value from the cache.

Feature flags are managed through `src/helpers/featureFlags.js`:

- `isEnabled(flag)` – synchronous check for a flag's enabled state.
- `setFlag(flag, value)` – persist a flag change and emit an update.
- `featureFlagsEmitter` – listen for `change` events when flags toggle.

Call `loadSettings()` during startup to populate the cache before using
these helpers. Pages should rely on `featureFlags.isEnabled` rather than
accessing `settings.featureFlags` directly.

> `navigationItems.json` and `gameModes.json` must be present on the server; otherwise, the game loads built-in fallback data.

## Vector Search Helpers

Utilities for working with the embedding database are centralized in
`src/helpers/vectorSearch/index.js`. The default export provides methods to
load embeddings, expand queries, find matches, and fetch surrounding
context:

```javascript
import vectorSearch from "./src/helpers/vectorSearch/index.js";
const embeddings = await vectorSearch.loadEmbeddings();
const expanded = await vectorSearch.expandQueryWithSynonyms("grip fighting");
const results = await vectorSearch.findMatches([0, 1, 0], 5, ["prd"], expanded);
```
## ⚡ Module Loading Policy: Static vs Dynamic Imports

JU-DO-KON! favors **deterministic gameplay and snappy input handling**. Use **static imports** for core gameplay; reserve **dynamic imports** (`import('…')`) for optional screens and heavy tools.

**Use static imports when the code:**
- Runs on a **hot path** (stat selection, round decision, event dispatch, per-frame animation).
- Is **always required** in a typical play session.
- Should **fail at build/startup** if broken (orchestrators, rules, event bus).

**Use dynamic imports (with preload) when the code:**
- Powers **optional** or **infrequent** screens (Settings, Tooltip Viewer, Credits, docs).
- Is **heavy** or behind a **feature flag** (canvas/WebGL renderer, debug panels, markdown/HL libs).
- Can be **preloaded** during idle/cooldown to hide latency.

**Hot path (for this project) =**
- Stat selection handlers → round outcome
- Rules engine / orchestrators / event dispatchers
- Animation tick or per-frame rendering used during battle

## 🧪 Testing

The game includes a **Skip** button that bypasses the current round and cooldown timers. Use it to fast-forward through matches when debugging or running rapid gameplay tests.

Run all Playwright tests with:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

### Battle Debug Panel

Enable the `battleDebugPanel` feature flag to display a panel above the player and opponent cards with live match data. The panel includes a **Copy** button that copies all text for easy sharing.


Screenshot suites store their baseline images in `playwright/*-snapshots/`. To skip running these comparison tests locally, set the `SKIP_SCREENSHOTS` environment variable:

```bash
SKIP_SCREENSHOTS=true npx playwright test
```

When a UI change intentionally alters a screenshot, update the stored snapshots with:

```bash
npx playwright test --update-snapshots
```

## 🔄 Updating Judoka Card Codes

Run `npm run update:codes` whenever you add or edit judoka in `src/data/judoka.json`. The script regenerates the `cardCode` for each entry and falls back to the code from judoka `id=0` if generation fails.
