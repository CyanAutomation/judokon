## 👩‍💻 Contributing

Whether you're a developer, designer, tester, writer—or an AI agent—we welcome contributions to JU-DO-KON!

## 🤖 AI Agent Compatibility

JU-DO-KON! welcomes structured, scoped contributions from AI agents. Agents are encouraged to help improve gameplay logic, design consistency, data integrity, and documentation.

Typical agent tasks include:

- Performing PRD evaluations and feature readiness checks
- Auditing tooltips and `data-*` observability hooks
- Validating feature flags and DOM compatibility
- Ensuring judoka stat data follows game rules

AI agents should begin by reading:

- [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for task guides and scope
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for commit conventions
- [architecture.md](./architecture.md) for layout structure and observability models

## 🧭 Quickstart for AI Agents

### 🔑 Entry Points

- `/src/pages/settings.html` – UI for toggling feature flags
- `/data/tooltips.json` – Tooltip content (auditable by agents)
- `/data/judoka.json` – Card data for stat logic
- `/components/` – Frontend logic with `data-*` hooks for observability

### 🧪 Common Tasks

- ✅ Check for missing tooltips on interactive elements
- ✅ Validate stat blocks against rarity rules
- ✅ Generate or evaluate PRDs for new features

## 🔄 Updating Judoka Card Codes

Run `npm run update:codes` whenever you add or edit judoka in `src/data/judoka.json`. The script regenerates the `cardCode` for each entry and falls back to the code from judoka `id=0` if generation fails.
