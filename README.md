## Quick Start

1. Make sure you have **Node 18+** and `npm` (or another package manager) installed.
2. Clone the repository, install dependencies, and launch the development server:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cyanautomation/judokon.git
   cd judokon
   npm install
   npm start  # lightweight local dev server
   # Then visit: http://localhost:5000
   ```
3. Verify formatting and linting before committing:

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

   **For UI-related changes**, also verify color contrast. Make sure a local server (for example `npm start`) is running so Pa11y can access http://localhost:5000:

   ```bash
   npm run check:contrast  # runs Pa11y against http://localhost:5000
   ```

### Debug Logging

To see verbose output from the helper modules during development, enable the
`DEBUG_LOGGING` flag:

```bash
# Node/CLI
DEBUG_LOGGING=true npx vitest run
```

In the browser you can enable it from the console before loading the page:

```javascript
window.DEBUG_LOGGING = true;
```

## Screenshot Tests (On-Demand)

Run optional Playwright-based screenshot tests with:

```bash
npm run test:screenshot
```

The screenshot suite now runs once for **each browser project** configured in
`playwright.config.js`. Snapshot images are saved under
`playwright/<spec>.spec.js-snapshots/<project>/`.

Remember **not** to commit files in `playwright/*-snapshots` when screenshots
change. Use `npx playwright test --update-snapshots` to regenerate the baseline
images locally.

Set `SKIP_SCREENSHOTS=true` to skip the screenshot suite if you only want to run
the other Playwright tests:

```bash
SKIP_SCREENSHOTS=true npm run test:screenshot
```

## Project Structure

The repository follows a simple layout. GitHub Pages requires `index.html` to live at the project root.

- `index.html` â€“ landing page served by GitHub Pages. Internal navigation links
  use relative paths (e.g., `../../index.html`) so the site can be served from
  any base URL.
- `src/` â€“ contains the game logic and assets:
  - `game.js`
  - `helpers/` â€“ small utilities (for example `lazyPortrait.js` replaces the placeholder card portraits once they enter view)
  - `components/` â€“ small DOM factories like `Button`, `ToggleSwitch`, `Card`, the `Modal` dialog, and `StatsPanel`

    ```javascript
    import { createStatsPanel } from "./src/components/StatsPanel.js";
    const panel = createStatsPanel(
      { power: 9, speed: 8, technique: 7 },
      { ariaLabel: "Shohei Ono stats" }
    );
    document.body.appendChild(panel);
    ```

    `Card.js` applies the same design tokens for colors and spacing.

    ```javascript
    import { createCard } from "./src/components/Card.js";
    const card = createCard("<p>Hello</p>");
    document.body.appendChild(card);
    ```

    `Modal.js` exports a dialog component with keyboard focus trapping.

    ```javascript
    import { createModal } from "./src/components/Modal.js";
    const contentFragment = document.createDocumentFragment();
    const modalContent = document.createElement("p");
    modalContent.textContent = "This is a modal dialog.";
    contentFragment.appendChild(modalContent);
    const modal = createModal(contentFragment, { labelledBy: "modalTitle" });
    document.body.appendChild(modal.element);

    // Example: Wire up open() and close() methods to button clicks
    const openButton = document.createElement("button");
    openButton.textContent = "Open Modal";
    openButton.addEventListener("click", () => modal.open());
    document.body.appendChild(openButton);

    const closeButton = document.createElement("button");
    closeButton.textContent = "Close Modal";
    closeButton.addEventListener("click", () => modal.close());
    modal.element.appendChild(closeButton);
    ```

    Call `open()` on a user action and focus stays trapped until `close()` runs.

    `lazyPortrait.js` enables IntersectionObserver-based image loading. The
    `renderJudokaCard` and `buildCardCarousel` helpers automatically call
    `setupLazyPortraits()` so portraits swap in when cards enter view. Import and
    call it manually only if you build card markup yourself.

  - `pages/`
    HTML pages. Each page imports a matching module from
    `src/helpers` (for example `randomJudokaPage.js`) that wires up its
    interactive behavior. The directory also contains
    `mockupViewer.html`, a simple carousel for browsing the image files
    under `design/mockups/`. It displays the filename overlay, centers
    each image, and scales it to fit the viewport. The page now
    centers all of its content for a consistent layout.
  - `data/`
  - `schemas/`
    JSON Schema definitions used to validate the data files.
  - `assets/`
    Card art and UI graphics, including `cardBacks/cardBack-2.png` used when a card flips.
  - `styles/`

- `tests/` â€“ Vitest unit tests.
  - `design/` â€“ documentation and code standards.
  - [Architecture Overview](design/architecture.md) â€“ summary of key modules.

### PRD Reader

Product Requirements Documents live in `design/productRequirementsDocuments`.
Add new Markdown files there and include the filename in the `FILES` array of
`src/helpers/prdReaderPage.js`. Open `src/pages/prdViewer.html` in your browser
to browse the documents with next/previous navigation. Buttons tagged with
`data-nav="prev"` and `data-nav="next"` appear in both the header and footer.
The page now imports `base.css` and `layout.css` so wide elements stay wrapped
inside the viewport. Navigation buttons remain left-aligned with a gap so they
don't interfere with the centered content. Users can return to the main menu via the Home button.

### CSS Organization

- `base.css` â€“ tokens, resets, and global typography.
- `layout.css` â€“ overall page layout/grid.
- `components.css` â€“ reusable UI components. All `<button>` elements
  use design tokens such as `--button-bg` and `--button-text-color`.
  `setupButtonEffects()` adds a Material-style ripple when buttons are
  clicked. An optional `.secondary-button` class provides a lighter
  variant.
- `utilities.css` â€“ helper classes.
- Page-specific files such as `carousel.css` and `quote.css`.

Import styles in this order: `base.css` first, then layout and component files, and finally `utilities.css`.

Global rules should not be repeated across files.

All pages include a fixed header and persistent bottom navigation bar. The body has top and bottom padding to ensure content scrolls under these elements.

The `.animate-card` class in `components.css` reveals new cards with a short
fade and upward slide. A `prefers-reduced-motion` media query removes the
animation so the card appears instantly when motion reduction is requested.

## Data Schemas and Validation

JSON files in `src/data` are validated against matching schemas in `src/schemas`.
Validate all data files at once with the npm script (which runs `scripts/validateData.js`):

```bash
npm run validate:data
```

You can also validate a single pair manually:

```bash
npx ajv validate -s src/schemas/judoka.schema.json -d src/data/judoka.json
```

See [design/dataSchemas/README.md](design/dataSchemas/README.md) for full details
and instructions on updating schemas when data changes.

The repository specifies commenting standards in design/codeStandards. JSDoc comments and @pseudocode blocks must remain intact, as shown in documentation excerpts.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play JUDOKON!

**JUDOKON!** is a fast-paced, Top Trumps-style card game featuring real-life elite judoka. You play against the computer in a battle of stats â€” first to 10 wins takes the match!

### ðŸ¥‹ The Rules:

1. **You vs. Computer**
   - Each match starts with both players receiving **25 random cards** from a 99-card deck.

2. **Start the Battle**
   - In each round, you and the computer each draw your top card.

3. **Choose Your Stat**
   - You select one of the stats on your card (e.g. Power, Speed, Technique, etc.)

4. **Compare Stats**
   - The chosen stat is compared with the computerâ€™s card.
   - **Highest value wins the round**.
   - If both stats are equal, itâ€™s a **draw** â€” no one scores.

5. **Scoring**
   - Each round win gives you **1 point**.
   - The cards used in that round are **discarded** (not reused).

6. **Winning the Match**
   - First player to reach **10 points** wins!
   - If **neither player reaches 10 points after 25 rounds**, the match ends in a **draw**.

## Live Demo

Try the game live in your browser: [JU-DO-KON!](https://cyanautomation.github.io/judokon/)

- No installation required.
- Fully playable with all features.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the game.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For game logic and interactivity.
- **Vite**: For building and bundling the project.
- **Marked**: Minimal parser used in the PRD reader that now supports nested ordered and unordered lists, bold text, tables, and horizontal rules.
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting the live demo.

## Known Issues

- The game currently does not support mobile devices.
- Animations for card flips are now implemented.
- Difficulty levels for the computer opponent are under development.

## Display Modes

JU-DO-KON! supports **light**, **dark**, and **gray** themes. The
`applyDisplayMode` helper sets a `data-theme` attribute on the `<body>` element
so CSS in `src/styles/base.css` can override variables for each mode. Define a
new theme by adding a `[data-theme="my-theme"]` block with your custom
variables and call `applyDisplayMode("my-theme")` to activate it.

If you modify theme colors, run `npm run check:contrast` while the development
server is running to verify adequate color contrast.

## Browser Compatibility

JU-DO-KON! is tested in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
The card carousel uses modern CSS like `clamp()` for flexible sizing. Safari 15
and older do not support `clamp()`, so cards fall back to a fixed `300px` width.
Safari may expand flex items if `min-width` isn't explicitly set. Set
`min-width: 0` on `.card-carousel` so horizontal scrolling works correctly.

- Safari â‰¤15 doesn't treat `aspect-ratio` as a definite height. `.judoka-card` now sets `height: calc(var(--card-width) * 1.5)` with `.card-top-bar` using `calc(var(--card-width) * 0.14)` so the header height remains consistent.
  Safari 18 has a regression where flex items grow when scroll buttons are inline
  with the carousel. Apply `min-width: 0` to `.carousel-container` and position
  `.scroll-button` absolutely to keep the carousel inside the viewport.
  Another Safari quirk allows the placeholder `#carousel-container` element to
  expand based on its children, producing a page wider than the viewport. Assign
  `width: 100%`, `min-width: 0`, and `overflow: hidden` to `#carousel-container`
  to constrain the carousel on this browser.
  Mobile Safari supports smooth scrolling via
  `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`.
  Safari may expand grid columns when the container width is undefined.
  Setting `width: 100%` on both `.kodokan-grid` and `.kodokan-screen`
  keeps the carousel from stretching beyond the viewport.
  Safari counts scrollbars in the `vw` unit, which can lead to unexpected layout behavior. For example, a wrapper with `min-width: 100vw` may become wider than the page and cause horizontal scrolling. To prevent this, set `width: 100%` on the body and navbars. Optionally, use `overflow-x: hidden` to ensure the layout stays within the viewport.
  Mobile Safari 18.5 may also add vertical scroll if fixed headers and footers use `vh` units. The navbar height CSS variables now use `dvh` to match the dynamic viewport height and avoid extra scrolling. Pages with fixed headers or footers should set container heights to `calc(100dvh - var(--header-height) - var(--footer-height))` (or equivalent) so content isn't hidden when the viewport shrinks. The `.home-screen` container implements this rule.

Safari 18.5 positions `.signature-move-container` text at the bottom edge unless the container uses standard flex alignment. The container now applies `line-height: max(10%, var(--touch-target-size))` along with `align-items: center` and `justify-content: center`. Setting `width: 100%` on the child spans prevents stretching so the label and value remain vertically centered.

Safari 18.5 sometimes shrinks judoka cards, causing text overlap. The width rule now uses `clamp(200px, 70vw, 300px)` so cards occupy about 70% of the viewport on mobile. This applies to both the random card view and the browse carousel.

Chrome may show a small gap below the stats panel when the combined height of
card sections is less than 100%. Ensure `.card-top-bar`, `.card-portrait`,
`.card-stats`, and `.signature-move-container` together fill the card height to
avoid this issue.

The card layout now uses CSS grid rows (`calc(var(--card-width) * 0.14)`,
`42%`, `38.67%`, `max(10%, var(--touch-target-size))`) so the stats panel and
signature move band stack directly against each other in Safari and Chrome.

The bottom navbar uses `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` with a `constant()` fallback to add extra padding and height. This prevents it from overlapping the iOS home indicator and keeps content visible.

Layout containers should include a `vh` fallback declared before the `dvh` rule so browsers without dynamic viewport support still size elements correctly.
The settings screen previously had its first controls hidden behind the header; wrapping the page in this `.home-screen` container resolves the issue. The page now starts with an `<h1>` heading and two `<fieldset>` sections labeled **General Settings** and **Game Modes**. The classic battle page also uses this wrapper so the judoka cards appear fully below the header.

## Future Plans

- Get feedback on current cards and stat points
- Take submissions/suggestions on new card designs and stats
- Add stat comparison animations
- Implement difficulty levels for the computer opponent
- Expand the card deck with more judoka and stats
