# Development Progress Log

## Phase 1: Critical Bug Fix - Stat Loading Failure (September 12, 2025)

### Issue Summary
The Classic Battle CLI had a critical bug where stat selection lists never appeared after starting a match, making the game completely unplayable. The issue was identified through audit findings in `progress.md`.

### Root Cause Analysis
Through detailed debugging with console logging, I discovered that:

1. ✅ `renderStatList()` was working correctly and populating 5 stat buttons
2. ✅ Stat data was loading properly from fallback module when JSON fetch failed
3. ✅ DOM elements were being created and appended correctly
4. ❌ **But immediately after, `clearSkeletonStats()` was clearing all the real content!**

### The Bug
The issue was in the interaction between `renderStatList()` and `clearSkeletonStats()`:

1. HTML starts with skeleton placeholder content but no `data-skeleton` attribute
2. `renderStatList()` populates real stats correctly
3. `clearSkeletonStats()` gets called and checks `stats.dataset.skeleton`
4. Since `dataset.skeleton` was undefined (not "true"), the function incorrectly cleared the real content
5. This left the stats container empty, making the game unplayable

### Solution Implemented
**File:** `/src/pages/battleCLI/init.js`

**Change:** Added `list.dataset.skeleton = "false"` after populating real stats in `renderStatList()`:

```javascript
// Mark as not skeleton after adding real content to prevent clearSkeletonStats from clearing it
list.dataset.skeleton = "false";
```

This ensures that `clearSkeletonStats()` recognizes that real content has been loaded and doesn't clear it.

### Testing & Validation

**Before Fix:**
- ❌ Found 0 stat elements
- ❌ Empty stats container content
- ❌ Game unplayable - no stat selection possible

**After Fix:**
- ✅ Found 5 stat elements
- ✅ Full stats container with proper HTML structure
- ✅ All Playwright tests still pass (12/12)
- ✅ Proper focus management and accessibility attributes

### Files Modified
- `/workspaces/judokon/src/pages/battleCLI/init.js` - Fixed skeleton clearing logic

### Impact
- **P0 Critical Issue RESOLVED** - Game is now playable
- Core stat selection functionality restored
- All existing tests continue to pass
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Next Steps
This completes Phase 1 of the action plan from `progress.md`. The next phases will address:
- Phase 2: Keyboard navigation for match length selection
- Phase 3: Match length/win target synchronization 
- Phase 4: Polish and comprehensive testing

## Development Notes

### Debugging Approach Used
1. Added comprehensive console logging to trace execution flow
2. Created temporary Playwright test to capture browser console output
3. Identified the exact sequence where stats were cleared
4. Applied minimal fix with proper state management
5. Verified fix with existing test suite

### Key Lesson
State management between initialization functions needs careful attention to prevent race conditions and unintended side effects. The `data-skeleton` attribute pattern needed to be properly maintained throughout the lifecycle.
