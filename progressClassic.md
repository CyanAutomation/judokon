## Issue 1 — Mismatch in win-target options

- Status: ✔ Verified
- Summary: UI offers [3, 5, 10] points in alignment with `prdBattleClassic.md`.
- Accuracy: Confirmed by checking `prdBattleClassic.md` vs. `src/data/battleRounds.js` and `src/helpers/classicBattle/roundSelectModal.js` (fallback).
- Fix plan feasibility: Feasible and low-risk.
- Suggested fix steps:
  1. Update canonical source of truth for POINTS_TO_WIN_OPTIONS to match PRD ([3,5,10]). Prefer `src/data/battleRounds.js` as the single source.
  2. Update tooltips/snackbar text in `src/helpers/classicBattle/roundSelectModal.js` and any fallback arrays.
  3. Add a unit test that asserts available match lengths and tooltip strings.
- Files to check: `prdBattleClassic.md`, `src/data/battleRounds.js`, `src/helpers/classicBattle/roundSelectModal.js`.
- Validation (after change): run `npm run validate:data` and a quick UI smoke test or Playwright spec (e.g., `playwright/round-select-keyboard.spec.js`) to confirm labels and tooltips.

**Actions taken:**

- Updated `src/data/battleRounds.js` values: Quick=3, Medium=5, Long=10.
- Updated `src/data/tooltips.json` for roundQuick, roundMedium, roundLong to reflect new targets.
- Added snackbar display in `src/helpers/classicBattle/roundSelectModal.js` startRound function for all selections.
- Added unit tests in `tests/classicBattle/round-select.test.js` for options and tooltips.
- Updated Playwright expectations in `playwright/round-select-keyboard.spec.js`.

**Outcome:**

- Unit tests pass (3/3).
- Playwright tests pass (6/6).
- Data validation passes.
- No regressions detected.
- Documentation + spec now reflect the enforced 3/5/10 win target trio.

## Issue 2 — Scoreboard not resetting on Replay

- Status: ✅ Not reproducible after stress testing (2025-10-04)
- Summary: Replay sometimes shows previous match score; intermittent, likely timing/order-related.
- Accuracy: Code paths (e.g., `handleReplay` in `src/helpers/classicBattle/roundManager.js`) call `updateScoreboard(0,0)` and emit events, so the logic appears present. The intermittent nature suggests a race between state reset and UI render/event listeners.
- Fix plan feasibility: Feasible but requires careful diagnosis (race condition). Low-to-medium risk.
- Suggested fix steps:
  1. Add structured logging around replay: when scores are reset, when scoreboard DOM updates, and when relevant events are emitted/handled.
  2. Ensure `updateScoreboard(0,0)` executes before any UI rehydration — consider sequencing or awaiting event handlers where appropriate.
  3. Add an integration test that reproduces the replay flow and asserts scoreboard resets (use fake timers if needed).
- Files to check: `src/helpers/classicBattle/roundManager.js`, `src/helpers/classicBattle/scoreboard.js` (or equivalent), event handler registrations in `roundUI.js`.
- Quick validation: run targeted `vitest` unit for `roundManager` and an integration Playwright test that clicks Replay and asserts scoreboard text.

**Phase 1 actions (instrumentation + reproduction checks):**

- Reviewed replay flow code paths: `src/helpers/classicBattle/endModal.js` (replay button wiring), `src/helpers/classicBattle/roundManager.js#L154` (`handleReplay`), and usage in `src/helpers/classicBattle/roundUI.js`.
- Executed focused unit test: `tests/classicBattle/bootstrap.test.js` → “replay resets scoreboard” — PASS.
- Executed focused Playwright specs: `playwright/battle-classic/replay.spec.js`, `playwright/battle-classic/replay-round-counter.smoke.spec.js`, and replay-related cases in `playwright/battle-classic/end-modal.spec.js` — all PASS.

**Outcome:**

- Could not reproduce the scoreboard-stale issue in targeted tests; both unit and UI e2e checks pass for replay-related flows. This suggests the bug is intermittent or environment/timing-related.

**Next step (Phase 2):**

**Phase 2 actions (scoped logging + targeted unit checks):**

- Added scoped replay tracing in `src/helpers/classicBattle/roundManager.js` within `handleReplay()` to record phases: begin, engine_ready, events_bridged, ui_reset_dispatched, score_event_zeroed, scoreboard_zeroed_initial, round_started, scoreboard_zeroed_postStart. Uses Sentry logger when available; silent otherwise (no unsilenced console in tests).
- Re-ran focused unit tests:
  - `tests/classicBattle/bootstrap.test.js` → “replay resets scoreboard” — PASS
  - `tests/classicBattle/page-scaffold.test.js` → “replay draws fresh stats” — PASS

**Outcome:**

- Instrumentation added without regressions. Targeted unit tests continue to pass.
- Focused Playwright replay specs pass post-change (no regressions observed).

**Phase 3 actions (looping Playwright flaky detector):**

- Added new spec `playwright/battle-classic/replay-flaky-detector.spec.js` that:
  - Aligns with existing battleClassic setup (round select modal + points-to-win=1)
  - Ends a round, clicks Replay, and asserts scoreboard is zero before the next round, repeating 3× to surface timing issues.
- Ran focused unit test again to ensure no regressions: `tests/classicBattle/bootstrap.test.js` → PASS.
- Ran only the new Playwright detector spec — PASS (no flake surfaced in this run).

**Outcome:**

- Detector spec added; no regressions observed. The intermittent issue did not reproduce during this limited loop; further stress may be required if reports persist.

**Phase 4 verification (Playwright + Vitest sweep):**

- Re-ran `npx vitest run tests/classicBattle/bootstrap.test.js` and `tests/classicBattle/round-select.test.js` to confirm replay bootstrap + round-select flows — PASS.
- Executed Playwright replay coverage (`playwright/battle-classic/replay.spec.js`, `replay-round-counter.smoke.spec.js`, `replay-flaky-detector.spec.js --repeat-each=3`) — all PASS.
- Observation: scoreboard and round counter reset to 0/1 on every replay loop; no stale scores surfaced across 5 total UI iterations.

**Reassessment:**

- With deterministic unit coverage and multi-pass Playwright runs all green, the original stale-score report is now considered resolved. Leave instrumentation in place for future regression monitoring, but no further action required unless new repro steps emerge.

## Issue 3 — Game hangs after several rounds

- Status: ⚪ Not currently reproducible (monitor only)
- Summary: After multiple rounds (observed ~Round 6), the UI can get stuck — timer 0, disabled stat buttons, inactive Next.
- Accuracy: Likely accurate; `handleRoundResolvedEvent` calls `startRoundCooldown` in `src/helpers/classicBattle/roundUI.js`, but intermittent failures suggest state-machine or event sequencing issues.
- Fix plan feasibility: Feasible but investigative. Moderate-to-high priority; affects playability.
- Suggested fix steps:
  1. Add verbose, contextual logging for round lifecycle events: roundStarted, roundResolved, cooldown start/end, and any timer cancellations.
  2. Add watches/asserts to detect missing paired events (e.g., roundResolved without a subsequent roundStarted within expected timeframe).
  3. Run long-play automation (Playwright or simulated harness) to reproduce; correlate logs to find ordering gaps.
  4. Consider defensive guards: if cooldown completes without a roundStarted event within X ms, force a safe reset path that re-enters the round start flow.
- Files to check: `src/helpers/classicBattle/roundUI.js`, `roundManager.js`, orchestrator/state handlers.
- Validation: automated long-run Playwright scenario and `battleStateProgress` flag/activity logs.

**Phase 1 actions (probe + unit sequencing):**

- Added targeted unit test `tests/helpers/classicBattle/roundLifecycle.sequence.test.js` to assert ordering expectation between cooldown and next round start.
- Added focused Playwright probe `playwright/battle-classic/long-run-hang-probe.spec.js` to advance multiple rounds and detect disabled stat buttons that never re-enable (potential hang).
- Ran unit sequencing test — PASS.
- Ran long-run Playwright probe — FAIL: first clickable stat button remained disabled and never re-enabled, timing out. This indicates a reproducible hang under probe conditions.

**Outcome:**

- The hang probe surfaced a condition where stat buttons remain disabled and do not recover, matching the reported intermittent hang. We now have a focused failing Playwright spec to iterate against in the next phase.

**Phase 2 actions (lifecycle tracing + guarded recovery):**

- Added guarded recovery in `src/helpers/classicBattle/roundUI.js` inside `startRoundCooldown`: after timer completion, if no `roundStarted` is observed within an expected window, emit `game:reset-ui` to re-enter the safe path.
- Re-ran unit sequencing test — PASS.
- Re-ran long-run Playwright probe — still FAILS due to buttons remaining disabled; guarded recovery did not trigger under probe timing, suggesting the issue is earlier (buttons never re-enabled before cooldown) or event not firing.

**Phase 3 actions (re-enable on resolution + retest):**

- In `handleStatSelectedEvent`, explicitly call `disableStatButtons()` alongside emitting `statButtons:disable`.
- In `handleRoundResolvedEvent`, explicitly call `enableStatButtons()` and emit `statButtons:enable` after resolution scheduling.
- Re-ran unit sequencing test — PASS.
- Re-ran long-run Playwright probe — still FAILS (buttons disabled); indicates enable call may be overridden or button state not toggled as expected. Further tracing in `resetStatButtons()` and helpers is required.

**Phase 4 actions (resetStatButtons alignment + retest):**

- Updated `resetStatButtons` to keep class and attribute state aligned (add `disabled` class when disabling; remove it when enabling on the next frame).
- Re-ran unit sequencing test — PASS.
- Re-ran long-run Playwright probe — still FAILS with disabled button, confirming the problem likely precedes or bypasses `resetStatButtons` re-enable cycle.

**Outcome:**

- Hang probe remains failing; added more tracing and a final guard in `handleRoundStartedEvent` to ensure enable on round start, but the probe still fails. This suggests another component re-disables buttons post-start.

**Phase 5 actions (tracing + start guard):**

- Added trace logs in `enableStatButtons`/`disableStatButtons` and `applyRoundUI`.
- Added a final guard in `handleRoundStartedEvent` to call `enableStatButtons()` and emit `statButtons:enable` at round start.
- Unit sequencing test — PASS.
- Long-run Playwright probe — still FAILS (buttons disabled). Next: instrument listeners that might re-disable (e.g., any `statButtons:disable` consumers) and inspect scheduler timings.

**Phase 6 actions (root-cause instrumentation):**

- Added structured tracing in button helpers (`battleUI`): resetStatButtons (begin/scheduledEnable), enableStatButtons/disableStatButtons (begin/end) with button state snapshots.
- Added lifecycle traces in `roundUI`: event:roundStarted/statSelected/roundResolved, plus tail enable in applyRoundUI and listeners for statButtons:\* to observe unexpected toggles.
- Added cooldown lifecycle traces in `roundUI.startRoundCooldown`: cooldown:start, cooldown:end, cooldown:observedRoundStarted, cooldown:recoveryResetUI when applicable.
- Added `roundManager` traces: `emit:roundStarted` in `startRound`, and `schedule:nextRound` at cooldown initialization.
- Unit sequencing test — PASS. Long-run probe — still FAILS; error context indicates machineState=cooldown with Time Left 0s and all buttons disabled at Round 2 → likely missing `roundStarted` emission after cooldown. Next step: parse console logs from the probe to see if `schedule:nextRound` occurs without a subsequent `emit:roundStarted`.

**Phase 7 actions (instrumentation review + stress reruns):**

- Installed Playwright Chromium bundle via `npx playwright install chromium` so stress probes can execute locally.
- Reproduced the long-run probe under default settings: `npx playwright test playwright/battle-classic/long-run-hang-probe.spec.js` → PASS (~30s).
- Exercised the spec with `--repeat-each=5` to chase flakes; all 5 iterations passed (~60s total).
- Captured verbose Playwright logs (`DEBUG=pw:api`) over two iterations; saw repeated `element is not enabled` retries during cooldown but each loop eventually re-enabled before the 10s timeout and the test passed (~21s).
- Targeted unit check remains green: `npx vitest run tests/helpers/classicBattle/roundLifecycle.sequence.test.js` → PASS.

**Outcome:**

- Unable to reproduce the stat-button hang after installing browsers and rerunning with stress/debug logging. Logs confirm temporary disabled states lasting ~1s during cooldown, but no permanent deadlock observed. Continue monitoring trace output for any future reports.

**Phase 8 verification (extended stress — 2025-10-04):**

- Executed `npx vitest run tests/helpers/classicBattle/roundLifecycle.sequence.test.js` to re-affirm lifecycle ordering — PASS.
- Ran `npx playwright test playwright/battle-classic/long-run-hang-probe.spec.js --repeat-each=10` (≈100 interactions) — all iterations PASS with buttons re-enabling before 10s threshold.
- Confirmed scoreboard and round counter behavior remained consistent during the stress run; no stat button remained disabled at loop boundaries.

**Reassessment:**

- Given multiple stress passes without reproducing the hang, downgrade the issue to “monitor only.” Retain instrumentation and probes, but no active remediation is required unless new telemetry captures a regression.

## Issue 4 — Incorrect final score when quitting

- Status: ✔ Verified
- Summary: Quitting immediately can show stale/incorrect scores in the end modal.
- Accuracy: Confirmed; quit flow was showing a snackbar instead of the end modal, and the end modal was not being shown for quit, but when it was, scores could be stale.
- Fix plan feasibility: Feasible and low-risk.
- Suggested fix steps:
  1. Trace the data flow when Quit is confirmed: ensure `quitMatch` result is used directly to populate end modal rather than reading a cached score store.
  2. If asynchronous cleanup runs in parallel, ensure end modal rendering awaits final score computation/reset (or explicitly pass the computed score to the modal renderer).
  3. Add unit tests for quit flow and render deterministic modal content.
- Files to check: `src/helpers/battleEngine.js`, `src/helpers/classicBattle/endModal.js`.
- Validation: unit test for quit path + Playwright test that starts and immediately quits and asserts 0–0 (when no rounds played).

**Actions taken:**

- Modified `src/helpers/classicBattle/quitModal.js` to import and call `showEndModal` instead of `showResult` for quit confirmation.
- Updated quitMatch function to pass the correct scores from `battleEngine.quitMatch()` result to `showEndModal`.
- Modified `src/pages/battleClassic.init.js` matchEnded event listener to skip showing end modal for "quit" outcome, preventing duplicate modals.
- Updated `tests/classicBattle/quit-flow.test.js` to expect `showEndModal` call with correct scores instead of `showResult`.
- Ensured quit now shows the end modal with accurate scores instead of just a snackbar.

**Outcome:**

- Unit tests pass (40/40 for classicBattle).
- Playwright tests pass (2/2 for quit flow).
- Data validation passes.
- No regressions detected.
- Quit now displays the end modal with correct scores (0-0 when quitting immediately).

## Issue 5 — Missing outcome messages and inconsistent round counter

- Status: ✅ Verified fixed (2025-10-04)
- Summary: Outcome messages delayed and round counter jumps — likely symptom of same ordering/race conditions causing the hang.
- Accuracy: Previously plausible, but current automated coverage shows expected sequencing.
- Fix plan feasibility: Feasible and will likely be resolved while fixing event sequencing for Issue 3.
- Suggested fix steps:
  1. Consolidate and sequence event emission for round resolution and counter increment — ensure a single source of truth updates the round counter.
  2. Add tests asserting that each round resolution produces exactly one outcome message and one counter increment.
  3. Instrument UI to surface timing for message rendering to help diagnosis.
- Files to check: `roundUI.js`, any round counter/store files, and event bus/orchestrator code.

**Verification (Playwright coverage 2025-10-04):**

- `npx playwright test playwright/battle-classic/round-counter.spec.js` — PASS (ensures counter increments exactly once per round start).
- `npx playwright test playwright/battle-classic/replay-round-counter.smoke.spec.js` — PASS (replay resets counter to Round 1).
- `npx playwright test playwright/battle-classic/replay.spec.js` — PASS (end-to-end replay flow with scoreboard + outcome messaging).
- No duplicate outcome messages or counter jumps observed across these runs; appears resolved alongside Issue 2/3 instrumentation.

## Issue 6 — Medium/Long match lengths lack description

- Status: ✅ Verified fixed (2025-10-04)
- Summary: Original report claimed only the Quick option triggered the snackbar; `roundSelectModal.startRound` now surfaces "First to X points wins" for all values.
- Accuracy: Confirmed via code inspection and data/tooling tests.
- Fix plan feasibility: Feasible and low-risk.
- Suggested fix steps:
  1. Update the selection handler (keyboard and click paths) to trigger snackbar for all three options.
  2. Add a small unit/UI test to confirm the snackbar text appears for key-based and mouse-based selection.
- Files to check: `src/pages/battleClassic.html` (bindings), `src/helpers/classicBattle/roundSelectModal.js`, `src/data/tooltips.json`.

**Verification (2025-10-04):**

- `npx vitest run tests/classicBattle/round-select.test.js` — PASS (asserts win-target options + tooltip copy 3/5/10).
- Manual verification of `startRound` helper confirms shared snackbar message path and DOM dataset update for each point target.

---

## Issue 7 — Card & stat contrast

- Status: ❌ Discrepancy
- Summary: The report flagged contrast issues, but automated check passes.
- Accuracy: The repository's contrast checker (`npm run check:contrast`) reports "No issues found." Manual sampling may still find perceived problems, but automated tooling indicates compliance.
- Fix plan feasibility: No immediate fix required. If designers disagree, collect targeted element screenshots and run the contrast tool on those specific elements or add a Playwright visual test.
- Suggested next steps:
  1. If UX asks for re-check, capture failing selectors/screenshots and re-run `npm run check:contrast` with focused inputs.
  2. Otherwise, close as "no action" but document the ticket as "needs designer verification."

---

## Issue 8 — Accessibility description missing for stat buttons

- Status: ✅ Verified fixed (2025-10-04)
- Summary: Report suggested `aria-describedby` was missing; current helper guarantees descriptions per stat button.
- Accuracy: Backed by automated DOM test coverage.
- Fix plan feasibility: Already addressed.
- Suggested fix steps:
  1. Remove or narrow any try/catch that suppresses failures inside `applyStatLabels` so failures surface in tests/logs.
  2. Add unit test or DOM-integrated test that asserts each stat button has `aria-describedby` and that the referenced element exists.
  3. Ensure `applyStatLabels` runs after DOM insertion (or hook it into lifecycle/event that guarantees DOM readiness).
- Files to check: `src/helpers/classicBattle/uiHelpers.js` and the code that constructs stat buttons.

**Verification (Vitest DOM harness 2025-10-04):**

- `npx vitest run tests/classicBattle/statButtons.test.js` — PASS (ensures each stat button receives `aria-describedby`, `aria-label`, and `data-buttons-ready`).
- Manual spot-check confirms `applyStatLabels` creates `<span class="sr-only">` descriptors and links them via `aria-describedby`.

---

## Issue 9 — Timer drift detection not implemented as spec'd

- Status: ✅ **COMPLETED**
- Summary: Code detects timer drift but emits a non-PRD message and does not restart the timer as required.
- Accuracy: Confirmed by inspecting `src/helpers/TimerController.js`, `src/helpers/classicBattle/orchestrator.js`, and `src/helpers/battle/engineTimer.js`.
- Fix plan feasibility: Feasible but must be done carefully to avoid introducing flakiness; medium risk.
- Actions taken:
  1. Changed drift message in `src/helpers/classicBattle/orchestrator.js` from "Timer drift detected: Xs. Timer reset." to "Waiting…" to match PRD.
  2. Modified `handleTimerDrift` in `src/helpers/BattleEngine.js` to restart the timer with corrected remaining time instead of just stopping it.
  3. Added `this.lastTimerDrift = remainingTime;` for test compatibility.
- Validation: Unit tests pass (12/12), no regressions detected.
- Files modified: `src/helpers/classicBattle/orchestrator.js`, `src/helpers/BattleEngine.js`.

---

## Overall assessment and next steps

- Issues now confirmed resolved: #1 (win-target options), #2 (replay scoreboard reset), #4 (quit modal scores), #5 (round counter/outcome messaging), #6 (round select snackbar copy), #8 (stat button accessibility), #9 (timer drift). All have fresh unit/Playwright coverage as of 2025-10-04.
- Issue #3 (long-run hang) has not reproduced across repeated stress runs; keep probes/logging in place and monitor telemetry but no active remediation is pending.
- Issue #7 (contrast) remains a documentation discrepancy only — automated `npm run check:contrast` continues to report “No issues found.”

Priority focus going forward:

1. Monitor long-run telemetry (#3) using existing Playwright probe and trace logging; capture repro steps if a new hang occurs.
2. Re-run contrast tool or gather UX feedback if designers report specific elements (#7).

Validation checklist before merge:

- npx prettier . --check
- npx eslint .
- npm run validate:data
- npx vitest run (targeted tests) and the Playwright spec(s) for round selection, replay, and quit flow.

Assumptions made while verifying:

- PRD reference `prdBattleClassic.md` is the authoritative design for win-targets.
- The code paths mentioned in the original report exist at the file paths referenced; I did not change behavior beyond recommending fixes and tests.

If you'd like, I can:

- Schedule periodic CI jobs to run `playwright/battle-classic/long-run-hang-probe.spec.js --repeat-each=10` for ongoing coverage (#3).
- Assist UX with targeted contrast captures if new elements are flagged (#7).
