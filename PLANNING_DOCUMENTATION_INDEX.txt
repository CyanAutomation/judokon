KEY POINTS SUMMARY
==================

What Problem Does This Solve?
  → Unit tests for battle pages are scattered across 9+ directories
  → No single command to run all battle page regression tests
  → New contributors can't easily find or add battle page tests
  → Makes regression testing before deployment difficult

What's the Solution?
  → Create tests/battles-regressions/ directory structure
  → Organize tests by page (classic, cli) and feature
  → Add npm scripts: npm run test:battles (and variants)
  → Update AGENTS.md with testing documentation

Key Benefits
  → Single command for regression testing: npm run test:battles
  → Clear organization for developers
  → Faster feedback than running full test suite
  → Easy to add new tests and prevent regressions
  → Extensible pattern for other critical pages

Implementation Timeline
  → Phase 1 (Setup): 1 week
  → Phase 2 (Migration): 2-3 weeks
  → Phase 3 (Cleanup): 1 week
  → Total: 4-5 weeks

NPM Scripts Added
  npm run test:battles           # All battle tests
  npm run test:battles:classic   # Classic Battle only
  npm run test:battles:cli       # CLI Battle only
  npm run test:battles:shared    # Shared components only
  npm run test:battles:watch     # Watch mode
  npm run test:battles:cov       # Coverage report

QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
===================

Q: Can we do this gradually?
A: Yes! Phase 2 is designed for gradual migration over 2-3 weeks.

Q: What if some tests are already in the right location?
A: Copy them to new location, keep originals until all dependencies updated.

Q: Do we need to move Playwright tests?
A: They can stay in playwright/battle-classic/ - documented but not moved.

Q: What if tests fail after migration?
A: Update import paths, check for dependencies, verify test setup runs.

Q: How do we handle test interdependencies?
A: Identify and resolve during Phase 2; most should be self-contained.

Q: Can we extend this to other pages?
A: Yes! Use same pattern for Browse Judoka, Settings, etc.

Q: Is this backward compatible?
A: Yes! Old tests continue to work during migration phase.

Q: How do we verify the migration is complete?
A: Run IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.txt verification section.

Q: What if something breaks?
A: Each phase is reversible; document issues and rollback if needed.
