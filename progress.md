# Battle State Indicator Analysis

## Summary

The PRD file `prdBattleStateIndicator.md` describes a UI component, `battleStateIndicator.js`, responsible for reflecting the state of the battle engine's finite-state machine.

Based on an analysis of the codebase, this component **has not been implemented**.

## Findings

1.  **File Not Found:** The entry point specified in the PRD, `src/helpers/battleStateIndicator.js`, does not exist.
2.  **No Alternative Implementation:** A global search for `battleStateIndicator.js` yielded no results, indicating the file has not been moved or renamed.
3.  **No Event Listeners:** A search for the event `control.state.changed`, which the component is supposed to consume, only shows results in documentation files. This suggests that no component in the current codebase is listening for this event.

## Conclusion

The functionality described in `prdBattleStateIndicator.md` is not present in the current codebase. The component needs to be created from scratch.

## Implementation Plan

Here is a plan to implement the `battleStateIndicator.js` component as described in the PRD.

### Phase 1: Scaffolding and Basic Structure (Completed)

*   **Task 1.1: Create the file and initial function.** (Completed)
*   **Task 1.2: Handle non-browser environments and feature flags.** (Completed)
*   **Task 1.3: Basic DOM element creation.** (Completed)

**Actions Taken:**
*   Created `src/helpers/battleStateIndicator.js` with the basic `createBattleStateIndicator` function.
*   Implemented checks for non-browser environments and the `featureFlag`.
*   Added logic to create and mount the root `<ul>` and announcer `<p>` elements.
*   Created `tests/helpers/battleStateIndicator.test.js` with initial tests for the scaffolding, which all passed.

### Phase 2: Catalog and Initial Rendering (Completed)

*   **Task 2.1: Fetch and process the state catalog.** (Completed)
*   **Task 2.2: Render the state list.** (Completed)
*   **Task 2.3: Set `isReady` and return values.** (Completed)

**Actions Taken:**
*   Implemented the logic to fetch and process the state catalog using the `getCatalog` function.
*   Added functionality to render the list of states from the catalog.
*   Set the `isReady` flag to `true` after the initial rendering.
*   Added a new test to `tests/helpers/battleStateIndicator.test.js` to verify the catalog fetching and rendering, which passed.

### Phase 3: State Change Handling and UI Updates (Completed)

*   **Task 3.1: Subscribe to the `control.state.changed` event.** (Completed)
*   **Task 3.2: Update the active state.** (Completed)
*   **Task 3.3: Update the announcer.** (Completed)
*   **Task 3.4: Implement `getActiveState`.** (Completed)

**Actions Taken:**n*   Subscribed to the `control.state.changed` event to receive state updates.
*   Implemented the logic to update the active state in the UI.
*   Updated the announcer with the current state.
*   Implemented the `getActiveState` function.
*   Added new tests to `tests/helpers/battleStateIndicator.test.js` and fixed a bug that was revealed.

### Phase 4: Advanced Features and Cleanup (Completed)

*   **Task 4.1: Handle unknown states.** (Completed)
*   **Task 4.2: Handle catalog version updates.** (Completed)
*   **Task 4.3: Implement the `cleanup` function.** (Completed)

**Actions Taken:**
*   Implemented handling for unknown states.
*   Added logic to reload the catalog when the version changes.
*   Improved the `cleanup` function to remove the component's DOM elements.
*   Added tests for these advanced features, which all passed.

### Phase 5: Testing (Completed)

*   **Task 5.1: Write unit tests.** (Completed)
*   **Task 5.2: Write integration tests.** (Deferred)

**Actions Taken:**
*   Reviewed and confirmed the completeness of the unit tests in `tests/helpers/battleStateIndicator.test.js`.
*   Deferred integration tests as they would require a more complete application setup, which is outside the scope of this task.
