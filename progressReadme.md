# Design Document Analysis and Recommendations

This document outlines the analysis of the `/design/` directory and provides recommendations for consolidating design documents into a single source of truth within the Product Requirements Documents (PRDs).

## Current State Analysis

### Existing PRD Structure
The project already has a comprehensive PRD system with **40 established PRDs** covering game features, UI components, and technical systems. The existing PRDs follow a consistent structure with sections for TL;DR, Problem Statement, Goals, User Stories, Functional Requirements, and Acceptance Criteria.

### Design Directory Contents
The `/design/` directory contains a mix of documents, including:

-   **Agent and Code Standards** (`agentWorkflows/`, `codeStandards/`) - 12 files defining development workflows, testing standards, and AI agent interaction patterns
-   **Character Design** (`characterDesign/`) - 2 files describing the "KG" character
-   **Technical Architecture** (`architecture.md`, `battleMarkup.md`, `eventNamingAudit.md`, `stateHandlerAudit.md`)
-   **Theme and Visual Design** (`retroThemeContrast.md`)
-   **Legacy Integration** (`battleCLI-legacy-alignment.md`)
-   **Testing Documentation** (`testing/classicBattleTesting.md`)
-   **Data Schema Documentation** (`dataSchemas/README.md`)

### Gap Analysis
Many of these documents represent important standards and guidelines that would benefit from the formal structure and visibility of PRDs. Currently, some critical development standards are scattered across multiple locations, making them harder to discover and maintain.

## Recommendations

### 1. **PRIORITY HIGH**: Consolidate Agent and Code Standards into New PRDs

The files in `design/agentWorkflows/` and `design/codeStandards/` contain critical development standards that are currently fragmented. These should be consolidated into focused PRDs for better discoverability and maintenance.

**Recommended new PRDs:**

-   **`prdDevelopmentStandards.md`** - Consolidate coding standards, naming patterns, JSDoc requirements, and pseudocode standards
-   **`prdTestingStandards.md`** - Consolidate unit testing standards, Playwright testing guidelines, and test naming conventions  
-   **`prdAIAgentWorkflows.md`** - Consolidate RAG usage guidelines, vector query examples, and agent interaction patterns

**Files to consolidate:**
-   `design/agentWorkflows/exampleVectorQueries.md`
-   `design/agentWorkflows/ragUsageGuide.md`
-   `design/agentWorkflows/RAG_QUERY_GUIDE.md`
-   `design/codeStandards/codeJSDocStandards.md`
-   `design/codeStandards/codeNamingPatterns.md`
-   `design/codeStandards/codePseudocodeStandards.md`
-   `design/codeStandards/codeUIDesignStandards.md`
-   `design/codeStandards/evaluatingPlaywrightTests.md`
-   `design/codeStandards/evaluatingUnitTests.md`
-   `design/codeStandards/prdRulesForAgents.md`
-   `design/codeStandards/settingsPageDesignGuidelines.md`
-   `design/codeStandards/testNamingStandards.md`

**Note**: The existing `prdVectorDatabaseRAG.md` already covers the technical implementation of the RAG system, so the new PRD should focus on usage patterns and workflows rather than implementation details.

### 2. **PRIORITY MEDIUM**: Create Character Design PRD

The files in `design/characterDesign/` describe the "KG" character and should be formalized into a proper PRD: `prdCharacterDesign.md`.

**Files to consolidate:**
-   `design/characterDesign/kgCharacterDesignDocument.md`
-   `design/characterDesign/kgCharacterPromptSheet.md`

### 3. **PRIORITY LOW**: Merge Battle CLI Updates

The document `design/battleCLI-legacy-alignment.md` contains updates to the Battle CLI that should be merged into the existing `prdBattleCLI.md` to maintain a single source of truth.

### 4. **PRIORITY MEDIUM**: Create UI Theme and Design System PRD

The document `design/retroThemeContrast.md` describes color palettes and theme guidelines. This should be expanded into a comprehensive PRD covering the entire design system: `prdUIDesignSystem.md`.

This PRD should include:
-   Color palettes and contrast requirements
-   Typography standards
-   Spacing and layout guidelines
-   Component design patterns
-   Accessibility requirements

### 5. **PRIORITY LOW**: Relocate Technical Architecture Documents

The following highly technical documents should be moved to `docs/technical/` as they are more reference material than product requirements:

-   `design/architecture.md` → `docs/technical/architecture.md`
-   `design/battleMarkup.md` → `docs/technical/battleMarkup.md`  
-   `design/eventNamingAudit.md` → `docs/technical/eventNamingAudit.md`
-   `design/stateHandlerAudit.md` → `docs/technical/stateHandlerAudit.md`
-   `design/testing/classicBattleTesting.md` → `docs/technical/classicBattleTesting.md`
-   `design/dataSchemas/README.md` → `docs/technical/dataSchemas.md`

## Identified Missing PRDs

Based on the analysis, the following PRDs should be created to formalize important aspects of the project:

### High Priority
-   **`prdDevelopmentStandards.md`** - Code quality, naming conventions, JSDoc requirements
-   **`prdTestingStandards.md`** - Testing methodologies and quality standards  
-   **`prdAIAgentWorkflows.md`** - RAG usage patterns and agent interaction guidelines

### Medium Priority
-   **`prdCharacterDesign.md`** - Character "KG" design specifications and guidelines
-   **`prdUIDesignSystem.md`** - Comprehensive design system including themes, colors, typography

### Potential Future PRDs
-   **`prdAccessibilityStandards.md`** - Centralized accessibility requirements and testing procedures
-   **`prdPerformanceStandards.md`** - Performance benchmarks and optimization guidelines

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Standards Consolidation (High Priority)
1.  Create the three high-priority PRDs for development, testing, and AI agent standards
2.  Consolidate existing scattered documentation into these PRDs
3.  Update existing PRDs to reference these new standards where appropriate
4.  Remove or archive redundant files after successful consolidation

### Phase 2: Design System Formalization (Medium Priority)  
1.  Create character design and UI design system PRDs
2.  Merge Battle CLI legacy alignment document
3.  Ensure all UI-related PRDs reference the new design system PRD

### Phase 3: Technical Documentation Cleanup (Low Priority)
1.  Create `docs/technical/` directory
2.  Move technical architecture documents
3.  Update any references to moved documents
4.  Ensure proper cross-referencing between PRDs and technical docs

## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before creating new PRDs, ensure they follow the established patterns:

- [ ] **Structure**: TL;DR, Problem Statement, Goals, User Stories, Functional Requirements, Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Prioritization**: Use P1/P2/P3 priority system for functional requirements
- [ ] **Completeness**: Include all required sections per `prdRulesForAgents.md`
- [ ] **Cross-references**: Link to related PRDs and technical documentation
- [ ] **Task tracking**: Include implementation tasks with completion status

## Benefits of This Consolidation

1.  **Single Source of Truth**: All standards accessible through the PRD system
2.  **Improved Discoverability**: PRD Viewer tool makes standards easily browsable
3.  **Consistent Structure**: All requirements follow the same format and prioritization
4.  **Better Maintenance**: Centralized updates rather than scattered file management
5.  **Enhanced AI Agent Integration**: Standards become part of the RAG system for automated reference

## Considerations and Challenges

### Potential Risks
-   **Temporary disruption**: Moving files may break existing references and bookmarks
-   **Size management**: Consolidating multiple documents may create very large PRDs that are harder to navigate
-   **Mixed content types**: Some current documents mix requirements with reference material

### Mitigation Strategies
-   **Gradual migration**: Implement changes in phases to minimize disruption
-   **Reference tracking**: Maintain a mapping of old locations to new PRD sections
-   **Content separation**: Keep requirements separate from detailed implementation notes
-   **Cross-linking**: Use clear section headers and internal links for easy navigation

### Success Metrics
-   All development standards accessible through PRD Viewer
-   Reduced time to find relevant standards and guidelines
-   Improved consistency in new feature development
-   Enhanced AI agent effectiveness through better RAG integration

## Approval and Review Process

This document serves as a proposal for design document consolidation. Before implementation:

1.  **Stakeholder review**: Ensure all teams agree with the proposed structure
2.  **Content audit**: Verify no critical information will be lost in consolidation
3.  **Migration plan**: Create detailed steps for each phase of implementation
4.  **Rollback plan**: Maintain ability to revert changes if issues arise
