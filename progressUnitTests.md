### Agent Assessment

This document provides a strong framework for improving unit test quality. The rubric-based scoring correctly identifies tests that are costly to maintain and provide low value. The analysis and recommendations align with modern testing best practices, emphasizing behavioral testing over implementation-detail testing.

The suggested plan is sound. The proposed updates below aim to add more specific, actionable details to the "Action" items and "Next Steps" to accelerate the remediation process.

## Lower-Performing Unit Tests

The list below shows the lowest-scoring tests according to the rubric (each category scored 0–2, total possible = 10). Use this as a prioritized checklist for cleanup: remove or merge noisy/duplicative tests, and refactor tests that assert implementation details instead of observable behavior.

| # | Test file | Intent clarity | Behavioral relevance | Assertion quality | Isolation & robustness | Cost vs coverage | Total | Action |
|---:|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|---|
| 1 | `tests/pages/battleCLI.helpers.test.js` | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 4 | **Refactor** (focus on observable output, not mocks) |
| 2 | `tests/pages/battleCLI.cliShortcutsFlag.test.js` | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 5 | Refactor |
| 3 | `tests/classicBattle/page-scaffold.test.js` | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 5 | Refactor |
| 4 | `tests/pages/battleCLI.standardDOM.test.js` | 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 6 | Refactor |
| 5 | `tests/styles/battleContrast.test.js` | 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 6 | Refactor |
| 6 | `tests/styles/battleCLI.focusContrast.test.js` | 2 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 7 | Refactor |

### Notes on selected tests

- `tests/pages/battleCLI.helpers.test.js` — Heavily mocked; asserts implementation details instead of user-observable outcomes. **This test is a prime candidate for refactoring to focus on the public contract of the helpers, not their internal wiring.**

These tests tend to: duplicate coverage, assert incidental DOM structure, or focus on internal wiring rather than observable contracts.

### Recommendations

- Remove or consolidate tests marked “Remove.” Replace them with smaller, behavior-focused tests where necessary.
- For tests marked “Refactor”:
	- Assert user-observable behavior (DOM text, emitted events, public API calls), not implementation details.
	- Reduce heavy fixture/setup cost where possible (use lightweight factories or component test utils, like those found in `tests/utils/componentTestUtils.js`).
	- Use fake timers and `withMutedConsole` in tests that are timing- or logging-sensitive to keep them deterministic. The `withMutedConsole` helper from `tests/utils/console.js` should be used for any test that intentionally triggers console warnings or errors.
	- Add one clear acceptance-style assertion per test (happy path) and a targeted edge-case where relevant.

### Next steps

1.  **DONE:** Delete or archive the “Remove” tests after confirming no unique coverage is lost.
    *   `tests/integration/manualDomComparison.test.js`
    *   `tests/examples/testArchitectureDemo.test.js`
    *   `tests/classicBattle/opponent-message-handler.simplified.test.js`
2.  **IN PROGRESS:** Create refactor tasks for each test flagged “Refactor”.
    *   **DONE:** `tests/integration/battleClassic.integration.test.js` - Refactored to a single, behavioral test verifying initial page state.
3.  Create refactor tasks for each remaining test flagged “Refactor”. Use the following template for each:
    ```
    **Refactor Test: `[Test File Path]`**

    **Current Problem:**
    - [ ] The test currently focuses on implementation details (e.g., internal state, mock calls).
    - [ ] The test has a high setup cost for its assertions.
    - [ ] The assertions are weak (e.g., only checking for element existence).

    **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - [ ] The test is refactored to assert user-observable behavior (e.g., final DOM state, text content, emitted events).
    - [ ] Mocks are minimized, and the test interacts with the component through its public API.
    - [ ] The test is deterministic and robust, using helpers like `withMutedConsole` and fake timers where appropriate.
    ```
4.  Re-run the test suite and measure improvements in run time and flakiness.
