### Agent Assessment

This document provides a strong framework for improving unit test quality. The rubric-based scoring correctly identifies tests that are costly to maintain and provide low value. The analysis and recommendations align with modern testing best practices, emphasizing behavioral testing over implementation-detail testing.

The suggested plan is sound. The proposed updates below aim to add more specific, actionable details to the "Action" items and "Next Steps" to accelerate the remediation process.

## Top 10 lower-performing unit tests

The list below shows the ten lowest-scoring tests according to the rubric (each category scored 0–2, total possible = 10). Use this as a prioritized checklist for cleanup: remove or merge noisy/duplicative tests, and refactor tests that assert implementation details instead of observable behavior.

| # | Test file | Intent clarity | Behavioral relevance | Assertion quality | Isolation & robustness | Cost vs coverage | Total | Action |
|---:|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|---|
| 1 | `tests/integration/manualDomComparison.test.js` | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 3 | **Remove** (brittle, implementation detail) |
| 2 | `tests/examples/testArchitectureDemo.test.js` | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 4 | **Remove** (demo/tutorial code) |
| 3 | `tests/classicBattle/opponent-message-handler.simplified.test.js` | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 | **Remove** (educational, duplicates coverage) |
| 4 | `tests/integration/battleClassic.integration.test.js` | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 4 | **Refactor** (assert behavior, not just existence) or remove |
| 5 | `tests/pages/battleCLI.helpers.test.js` | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 4 | **Refactor** (focus on observable output, not mocks) |
| 6 | `tests/pages/battleCLI.cliShortcutsFlag.test.js` | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 5 | Refactor |
| 7 | `tests/classicBattle/page-scaffold.test.js` | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 5 | Refactor |
| 8 | `tests/pages/battleCLI.standardDOM.test.js` | 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 6 | Refactor |
| 9 | `tests/styles/battleContrast.test.js` | 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 6 | Refactor |
| 10 | `tests/styles/battleCLI.focusContrast.test.js` | 2 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 7 | Refactor |

### Notes on selected tests

- `tests/integration/manualDomComparison.test.js` — Illustrative comparison between hand-built DOM and real HTML. **This test is brittle and tightly coupled to implementation details. Changes to the component's structure, even if behaviorally correct, will break it. Its maintenance cost is high for its low value.**
- `tests/examples/testArchitectureDemo.test.js` — Tutorial/demo content; it doesn't assert production behavior. **It should be moved to a separate documentation or examples directory, not kept in the main test suite.**
- `tests/classicBattle/opponent-message-handler.simplified.test.js` — Educational example that duplicates coverage available elsewhere. **Its primary value is instructional, making it a candidate for removal from the active test suite.**
- `tests/integration/battleClassic.integration.test.js` — Loads full HTML and logs internal state but only asserts element existence. **This is a high-cost, low-value integration test. It should be refactored to assert meaningful user-facing behavior or replaced with a more focused Playwright test.**
- `tests/pages/battleCLI.helpers.test.js` — Heavily mocked; asserts implementation details instead of user-observable outcomes. **This test is a prime candidate for refactoring to focus on the public contract of the helpers, not their internal wiring.**

These tests tend to: duplicate coverage, assert incidental DOM structure, or focus on internal wiring rather than observable contracts.

### Recommendations

- Remove or consolidate tests marked “Remove.” Replace them with smaller, behavior-focused tests where necessary.
- For tests marked “Refactor”:
	- Assert user-observable behavior (DOM text, emitted events, public API calls), not implementation details.
	- Reduce heavy fixture/setup cost where possible (use lightweight factories or component test utils, like those found in `tests/utils/componentTestUtils.js`).
	- Use fake timers and `withMutedConsole` in tests that are timing- or logging-sensitive to keep them deterministic. The `withMutedConsole` helper from `tests/utils/console.js` should be used for any test that intentionally triggers console warnings or errors.
	- Add one clear acceptance-style assertion per test (happy path) and a targeted edge-case where relevant.

### Next steps

1. Delete or archive the “Remove” tests after confirming no unique coverage is lost.
2. Create refactor tasks for each test flagged “Refactor”. Use the following template for each:
    ```
    **Refactor Test: `[Test File Path]`**

    **Current Problem:**
    - [ ] The test currently focuses on implementation details (e.g., internal state, mock calls).
    - [ ] The test has a high setup cost for its assertions.
    - [ ] The assertions are weak (e.g., only checking for element existence).

    **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - [ ] The test is refactored to assert user-observable behavior (e.g., final DOM state, text content, emitted events).
    - [ ] Mocks are minimized, and the test interacts with the component through its public API.
    - [ ] The test is deterministic and robust, using helpers like `withMutedConsole` and fake timers where appropriate.
    ```
3. Re-run the test suite and measure improvements in run time and flakiness.
