Notes on Selected Tests
Manual DOM comparison is an illustrative comparison between hand-built DOM and real HTML, offering little direct value to requirements
Architecture demo serves as a tutorial rather than a behavior check, covering no production logic
Simplified opponent message handler is another educational example, duplicating coverage provided elsewhere
Battle Classic integration test loads full HTML and logs internal state, yet only asserts element existence—costly for minimal coverage
BattleCLI helper exports relies heavily on mocks and asserts implementation details rather than user-observable behavior
These tests either duplicate coverage, check incidental DOM structure, or emphasize internal wiring over user-facing contracts. Consider removing or consolidating those marked “Remove/merge,” and tightening assertions or linking to explicit requirements for those marked “Refactor.”
