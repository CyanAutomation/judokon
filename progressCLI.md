# CLI Battle Mode QA Report

## Overview
This report details the current state of the CLI Battle Mode, focusing on identified bugs, inconsistencies, and areas for improvement based on recent QA cycles.

## Key Findings

### 1. Stat Selection Display Issues
- **Description:** During the stat selection phase, the displayed stats (e.g., "Power", "Speed") sometimes do not accurately reflect the underlying Judoka's actual stats. This appears to be a caching or synchronization issue.
- **Impact:** High - Directly affects player decision-making and fairness.
- **Reproducibility:** Consistent (9/10)
- **Proposed Fix:** Investigate `src/helpers/battleEngineFacade.js` and `src/components/StatDisplay.js` for data flow discrepancies. Implement a more robust state management solution for stat display, possibly leveraging a reactive pattern.
- **Opportunities for Improvement (Agent Review):**
    - **Accuracy & Feasibility:** The description and proposed fix are accurate and feasible. Data flow and synchronization are common culprits for such issues.
    - **Proposed Solution Alignment:** Before implementing a new reactive pattern, check existing patterns within the codebase (e.g., event emitters, RxJS, or a custom store). If no clear pattern exists, consider a lightweight, idiomatic solution that aligns with the project's existing JavaScript practices. Ensure that `battleEngineFacade.js` correctly exposes the real-time stat data and `StatDisplay.js` subscribes to these updates effectively.

### 2. Countdown Timer Inconsistencies
- **Description:** The countdown timer in the CLI sometimes skips seconds or displays incorrect values, especially under heavy load or rapid user input.
- **Impact:** Medium - Affects user experience and perceived responsiveness.
- **Reproducibility:** Intermittent (6/10)
- **Proposed Fix:** Review `src/helpers/countdownTimer.js` and its integration with the main battle loop. Ensure timer updates are debounced or throttled appropriately and synchronized with a central game clock.
- **Opportunities for Improvement (Agent Review):**
    - **Accuracy & Feasibility:** This is a common issue with UI timers. The proposed fix is sound.
    - **Proposed Solution Alignment:** For UI-related animations and smooth timer updates, consider using `requestAnimationFrame` or `scheduler.onFrame()` (as mentioned in `GEMINI.md` for continuous animations) instead of direct `setInterval`/`setTimeout` for rendering. This helps synchronize updates with the browser's refresh rate, leading to smoother visuals and reducing skipped frames. Debouncing/throttling might still be relevant for underlying logic, but UI rendering should prioritize `requestAnimationFrame`.

### 3. Post-Round Summary Glitches
- **Description:** After a round concludes, the summary screen occasionally shows incorrect winner/loser information or fails to clear previous round data, leading to visual clutter.
- **Impact:** Medium - Confuses players about round outcomes.
- **Reproducibility:** Intermittent (5/10)
- **Proposed Fix:** Examine `src/components/RoundSummary.js` and `src/helpers/battleEvents.js`. Ensure proper cleanup and re-initialization of UI components and data models after each round.
- **Opportunities for Improvement (Agent Review):**
    - **Accuracy & Feasibility:** This points to state management and component lifecycle issues. The proposed fix is appropriate.
    - **Proposed Solution Alignment:** Implement an explicit event-driven cleanup or a clear "reset" mechanism within `RoundSummary.js`. This reset should be triggered by a specific event (e.g., `roundEnd` or `roundReset` from `battleEvents.js`) to ensure all previous round data is cleared and the component is re-initialized correctly before displaying new summary information.

### 4. Input Handling Delays
- **Description:** User input (e.g., selecting a stat, confirming an action) sometimes experiences noticeable delays, leading to a sluggish feel.
- **Impact:** High - Degrades overall user experience and responsiveness.
- **Reproducibility:** Consistent (8/10)
- **Proposed Fix:** Audit `src/helpers/inputHandler.js` and its interaction with the event loop. Consider optimizing event listeners and reducing synchronous blocking operations.
- **Opportunities for Improvement (Agent Review):**
    - **Accuracy & Feasibility:** Input delays are critical for user experience. The proposed fix targets the right areas.
    - **Proposed Solution Alignment:** Investigate specific optimization techniques:
        - **Event Listeners:** Ensure event listeners are not performing heavy synchronous computations. Consider using `passive` event listeners for scroll/touch events if applicable to prevent blocking the main thread.
        - **Debouncing/Throttling:** Apply debouncing or throttling to rapidly firing events (e.g., resize, mousemove) if their handlers are computationally intensive.
        - **Web Workers:** For any truly heavy computations that cannot be avoided, offload them to Web Workers to prevent blocking the main thread.
        - **`requestIdleCallback`:** Utilize `requestIdleCallback` for non-essential, lower-priority background tasks to ensure they don't interfere with critical user-facing operations.

## General Recommendations

- **Code Review:** Conduct a focused code review on the identified files and their dependencies.
- **Unit Testing:** Enhance unit test coverage for battle-critical components, especially around state transitions and UI updates.
- **Performance Profiling:** Utilize browser performance tools to identify bottlenecks during gameplay.

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize fixes based on impact and reproducibility.
2. Assign tasks to relevant developers.
3. Re-QA after fixes are implemented.
