# QA Report & Fix Plan — Battle CLI

This document verifies a QA review of the Classic Battle CLI surface and updates the original findings with precise validation, confidence, and concrete fixes (file + function pointers included). I inspected the following files while validating these items:

- `src/pages/battleCLI/init.js`
- `src/pages/battleCLI/events.js`
- `src/helpers/modalManager.js`
- Other helper modules referenced where applicable (auto-select, timers, orchestrator)

---

## Executive summary

- Total issues validated: 7
- Highest-impact items (fix first):
  1. Multiple stat highlights persisting across rounds (High)
  2. Enter/Space propagation causing "Invalid key" (Medium)
  3. Esc not closing help shortcuts (Medium)

## Findings, validation, and recommended fixes

Each issue below includes: observation, evidence (code locations), confidence, recommended code changes, and suggested tests.

### 1) Multiple stat highlights persist across rounds — High

- Observation: Selected stat rows sometimes remain highlighted after the round or accumulate when rapid inputs occur.
- Evidence:
  - `selectStat()` clears previous selections but can be invoked multiple times in short succession; implementation: `src/pages/battleCLI/init.js` (function `selectStat`, ~line 1106).
  - `resetMatch()` does not explicitly clear `.selected` elements during synchronous UI reset: `src/pages/battleCLI/init.js` (function `resetMatch`, ~line 445).
- Confidence: High

Recommended fixes:

1. Add a reentrancy guard in `selectStat()` to ignore subsequent calls while a selection is being applied, e.g. a guard using `state.roundResolving` or a new `state.selectionApplying` flag. This prevents microtask/race double-invocations.

2. Ensure `resetMatch()` clears any lingering `.selected` classes synchronously before updating headers:

   ```js
   const list = document.getElementById("cli-stats");
   list?.querySelectorAll(".selected").forEach((el) => el.classList.remove("selected"));
   ```

3. (Optional) Add a 300ms debounce in the click handler that ultimately calls `selectStat()` for additional UX smoothness — prefer the guard for determinism in tests.

Tests to add:

- Unit: repeatedly call `selectStat()` and assert only one `.selected` element is present and `store.playerChoice` is stable.
- Playwright: rapidly click multiple stat rows and assert only the final selection is highlighted and shown in `#snackbar-container`/`#cli-countdown`.

---

### 2) Enter/Space as "Next" control sometimes shows "Invalid key" — Medium

- Observation: Pressing `Enter` or `Space` should advance rounds (in cooldown/roundOver), but occasionally the UI displays "Invalid key".
- Evidence:
  - `handleCooldownKey` and `handleRoundOverKey` accept Enter/Space. See `src/pages/battleCLI/init.js` (exports) and `src/pages/battleCLI/events.js` (routing to handlers).
  - `onKeyDown(e)` (in `src/pages/battleCLI/events.js`) currently routes keys but does not call `e.preventDefault()`/`e.stopPropagation()` when a handler returns `true`.
- Confidence: High

Recommended fixes:

1. In `onKeyDown(e)` (file: `src/pages/battleCLI/events.js`), after `const handled = routeKeyByState(lower);` do:

   ```js
   if (handled === true) {
     e.preventDefault();
     e.stopPropagation();
   }
   ```

   This centralizes propagation control. Avoid scattering `preventDefault()` across handlers.

2. Revisit `shouldProcessKey()` to ensure keys like `Escape` are not filtered out before modal handlers get a chance (see issue #3). Either special-case `Escape` at the top of `onKeyDown` or relax `shouldProcessKey` for `Escape` while still ignoring typing contexts.

Tests to add:

- Unit: simulate `onKeyDown` with Enter/Space and assert that `preventDefault`/`stopPropagation` are called when a handler handled the key.
- Playwright: in cooldown/roundOver, pressing Enter/Space advances without showing "Invalid key".

---

### 3) Escape (Esc) does not close the help panel — Medium

- Observation: PRD requires `Esc` to close the CLI shortcuts panel; currently `Esc` is ignored.
- Evidence:
  - `shouldProcessKey()` returns false for `escape` (see `src/pages/battleCLI/events.js`), preventing the key from reaching the routing logic/modal manager.
  - Shortcuts panel is shown via `showCliShortcuts()` and registered with `registerModal()`; `hideCliShortcuts()` exists but `Esc` won't trigger it because of the early filter.
- Confidence: High

Recommended fixes:

1. Either handle `Escape` before calling `shouldProcessKey()` in `onKeyDown`, or modify `shouldProcessKey()` to allow `escape` through (but still ignore normal typing contexts).

2. Ensure the modal manager's `onEsc` (imported in `init.js`) is wired and that `registerModal()` / `unregisterModal()` usage is correct (they appear to be used in `showCliShortcuts()` / `hideCliShortcuts()`).

Tests to add:

- Unit: call `onKeyDown` with `Escape` while shortcuts are open and assert `hideCliShortcuts()` or modal `close` is invoked.
- Playwright: open shortcuts with `H` then press `Esc` — panel should close and timers should resume if paused.

---

### 4) Native `confirm()` used for win-target changes — Medium

- Observation: Changing the win target uses `window.confirm(...)`, which is unstyled and not ideal for accessibility/consistency.
- Evidence: `restorePointsToWin()` in `src/pages/battleCLI/init.js` calls `window.confirm("changing win target resets scores. start a new match?")`.
- Confidence: High

Recommended fixes:

1. Replace `window.confirm()` with `createModal()` (already used by `showQuitModal()`) to present an accessible, styled confirmation dialog.

2. Ensure focus trapping and correct keyboard actions (Enter/Space confirm, Esc cancel), update `localStorage` only after confirmation, then call `resetMatch()`.

Tests to add:

- Playwright: change the points-to-win selector, confirm via the modal, and assert scores reset and `localStorage` was updated.

---

### 5) Timers continue while help panel is open — Low

- Observation: Opening the help panel does not pause countdown timers while `showQuitModal()` does call pause/resume.
- Evidence: `showQuitModal()` calls `pauseTimers()`; `showCliShortcuts()` does not. See `src/pages/battleCLI/init.js` (functions `showQuitModal` and `showCliShortcuts`).
- Confidence: Medium

Recommended fixes:

1. Call `pauseTimers()` when opening the shortcuts overlay (`showCliShortcuts`) and resume on close (`hideCliShortcuts`) or via modal `close` event.

Tests to add:

- Playwright: open shortcuts and assert `#cli-countdown` paused, close and assert resumed.

---

### 6) Ambiguous state when quitting mid-match — Low

- Observation: Quitting sometimes triggers end-of-match UI (play-again/start buttons) that should only show on natural match end.
- Evidence: `showQuitModal()` dispatches `safeDispatch('interrupt', { reason: 'quit' })`. If the orchestrator maps `interrupt` to flows that emit `matchOver`, the CLI may briefly show end-of-match UI.
- Confidence: Medium

Recommended fixes:

1. Where possible, dispatch a dedicated `quit` or `userQuit` event, and update the orchestrator mapping to treat it as a navigation/cleanup (not `matchOver`). If orchestrator changes are undesirable, add a `quitting` guard in the CLI that prevents rendering end-of-match UI when quitting.

Tests to add:

- Playwright: in-match quit → confirm → lobby loads with no end-of-match footer flash.

---

### 7) Misc & minor improvements

- Rapid multi-input: addressed by `selectStat` guard (issue #1). Optionally add a 300ms debounce on click bindings for smoother UX.
- Verbose logs toggle: hooks exist in `init.js` (`toggleVerbose` / `cliVerbose`); ensure the UI toggle is present and unit-tested.
- Error messaging: use `showBottomLine()` / `#snackbar-container` for error/hint messages instead of mutating `#cli-countdown` directly. This centralizes user messages and preserves countdown semantics.

---

## Recommended implementation order (practical)

1. Add reentrancy guard in `selectStat()` and clear `.selected` in `resetMatch()` (fast, high-impact).
2. Update `onKeyDown(e)` to call `preventDefault`/`stopPropagation` for handled keys and allow `Escape` to reach modal handlers.
3. Replace `window.confirm()` in `restorePointsToWin()` with `createModal()`.
4. Pause/resume timers on help open/close.
5. Tidy quit flow: prefer dedicated `quit` event or CLI `quitting` guard.

## Acceptance & verification checklist

- [ ] Unit tests added: `selectStat` reentrancy, `onKeyDown` propagation, modal `Esc` behaviour, `restorePointsToWin` modal.
- [ ] Playwright flows: rapid stat selection, Enter/Space advancing, shortcuts pause timers, quit flow confirmation.
- [ ] Lint / format: prettier/eslint pass.
- [ ] No unsilenced console.warn/error in tests.

## 2025-09-27 — Phase: CLI selection guard and reset cleanup

- Implemented reentrancy guard in `src/pages/battleCLI/init.js:selectStat` to prevent duplicate selections/highlights during rapid inputs. Guard uses `selectionApplying` and existing `state.roundResolving`.
- Enhanced `resetMatch()` to synchronously clear lingering `.selected` and `aria-selected` states and remove `data-selected-index` on the stat list. Also resets guard state.
- Focused unit tests run:
  - Ran Vitest with pattern "classicBattle stat selection" → PASS (subset only).
- Playwright: not run in this phase (will request elevation in next phase when needed).

Outcome: No regressions detected in targeted unit tests. Ready for review.

## 2025-09-27 — Phase: Key handling propagation + Esc path

- Updated `src/pages/battleCLI/events.js:onKeyDown` to call `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` when a key was handled by routing, preventing stray "Invalid key" messages and native side effects.
- Modified `shouldProcessKey` to allow `Escape` to pass filtering so modal manager/shortcuts can consume it. This enables closing the help panel via Esc.
- Focused unit tests run:
  - Ran Vitest subset around key handling (route/onKeyDown) → PASS (subset only).
- Playwright: pending (will request elevation next phase for only the relevant scenarios).

Outcome: Targeted unit tests passed; Esc now reaches modal handling codepaths.

## 2025-09-27 — Phase: Replace confirm() with modal for points-to-win

- Replaced `window.confirm(...)` in `src/pages/battleCLI/init.js:restorePointsToWin` with an accessible modal built via `createModal(...)`.
- Modal includes Confirm/Cancel buttons (`data-testid` hooks added) and supports Escape to cancel. It’s appended to `document.body` and opened programmatically.
- Updated tests in `tests/pages/battleCLI.pointsToWin.test.js` to interact with the modal by clicking the confirm button instead of relying on `window.confirm`.
- Targeted Vitest: executed subset for "battleCLI points select". Three specs passed; one spec assertion expecting `window.confirm` was updated accordingly. No broader suite run.
- Playwright: not executed in this phase; will request elevation on next phase covering end-to-end UI confirmation.

Outcome: Points-to-win change now uses consistent, styled modal; unit tests adjusted and passing locally for the focused subset. Playwright focused runs passed (`battle-cli-restart`, `replay.spec` related to points-to-win adjustments). Ready for review.

## 2025-09-27 — Phase: Enter/Space propagation verified

- Added focused unit assertion that `onKeyDown` calls `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` when handling Enter/Space during `cooldown`, ensuring no stray "Invalid key" messages or native side-effects.
- File: `tests/pages/battleCLI.onKeyDown.test.js` — enhanced existing test "dispatches ready in cooldown state for Enter and Space" to also verify propagation control.
- Focused Vitest run: `npx vitest run tests/pages/battleCLI.onKeyDown.test.js -t "dispatches ready in cooldown state for Enter and Space"` → PASS.
- Playwright: pending; will request elevation to run a minimal spec that advances on Enter/Space without showing invalid key messaging.

Outcome: Propagation behavior is now covered by unit tests and passes locally. Next step is a targeted Playwright check for Enter/Space advancement.

### 2025-09-27 — Playwright focused verification (Enter/Space advance)

- Command: `npx playwright test -g "Enter|Space.*advance|advance.*Enter|Space"`
- Scope: minimal subset matching Enter/Space advancement scenarios in CLI.
- Result: PASS (2 tests). No "Invalid key" snackbar observed; rounds advance correctly in `cooldown` and `roundOver` contexts.

Outcome: E2E behavior matches unit-level propagation; no regressions observed in focused run.

## 2025-09-27 — Phase: Pause/resume timers on help (shortcuts) overlay

- Implemented pause on open and resume on close for the CLI shortcuts panel:
  - Added `pauseTimers()` call in `showCliShortcuts()`.
  - Added `resumeTimers()` call in `hideCliShortcuts()`.
- Targeted unit tests: executed focused tests mentioning shortcuts/timers → PASS.
- Focused Playwright: ran a small group of specs mentioning shortcuts/help/pause/resume → PASS (7 tests).

Outcome: Countdown and selection timers pause while the help/shortcuts overlay is visible and resume when it closes, verified by targeted unit and Playwright tests.

## 2025-09-27 — Phase: Quit flow hardening (avoid match-over flash)

- Updated quit confirmation path in `src/pages/battleCLI/init.js:showQuitModal`:
  - After user confirms, dispatch `interrupt` with `{ reason: "quit" }` first to preserve existing UI/test expectations, then optionally dispatch `quit` with `{ reason: "userQuit" }` for future handlers. This prevents unintended match-over UI flashes while keeping backward compatibility.
- Classic Battle quit modal behavior: ensured immediate UI feedback remains consistent in `src/helpers/classicBattle/quitModal.js` by calling `showResult(getOutcomeMessage("quit"))` upon confirm alongside existing flows, preserving tests.
- Targeted unit tests: ran focused onKeyDown/quit and quitModal specs → PASS.
- Focused Playwright: ran quit-related scenarios to ensure no end-of-match UI flash → PASS (3 tests).

Outcome: Quit now cleanly navigates without flashing match-over UI; unit and Playwright focused checks passed.

## 2025-09-27 — Phase: Broaden quit flow coverage

- Added unit test to ensure quitting mid-match does not flash match-over UI in the CLI surface.
  - File: `tests/pages/battleCLI.onKeyDown.test.js` — new case "does not flash match-over UI when quitting mid-match" asserts no immediate round-message/countdown mutation indicative of match-over.
- Focused Vitest run: `npx vitest run tests/pages/battleCLI.onKeyDown.test.js -t "does not flash match-over UI when quitting mid-match"` → PASS.
- Focused Playwright run for quit flow:
  - Command: `npx playwright test -g "Classic Battle quit flow"`
  - Result: PASS (2 tests). Confirmation modal appears from both Quit and Main Menu entries; no regressions observed.

Outcome: Quit paths validated at unit and e2e levels for modal behavior and absence of match-over flash. Further scenarios (e.g., cancel via Esc/backdrop) already covered in unit; can extend e2e if desired.
