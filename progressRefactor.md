This roundManager.js file is quite complex, acting as a central hub
for battle state, UI updates, event handling, and timer management. This
monolithic structure makes it hard to maintain, debug, and test.

Here's a breakdown of its current responsibilities and complexities,
followed by a proposed refactoring plan:

Current Responsibilities & Complexities:

1. Battle State Management: Tracks currentRound, currentPhase, judoka data,
    selectedStat, etc. This state is extensive and intertwined with various
    functions.
2. Game Flow Control: Manages the progression through battle phases (e.g.,
    STAT_SELECTION, ROUND_RESOLUTION, BATTLE_ENDED), including starting and
    ending rounds.
3. UI Updates: Directly manipulates the DOM for round prompts, stat
    selection, scoreboard, snackbars, and battle results. This couples game
    logic with presentation.
4. Event Handling: Subscribes to and dispatches numerous battle-related
    events, with complex logic within each handler.
5. Timer Management: Handles multiple setTimeout and clearTimeout calls for
    countdowns and auto-selection, which are scattered and hard to track.
6. Stat Selection Logic: Determines stat selection, handles user input, and
    implements auto-selection.
7. Round Resolution Logic: Compares stats and determines the round winner.
8. Sound Effects: Triggers various sound effects.

Key Issues:

- Monolithic: High coupling, making changes risky and understanding
  difficult.
- Intertwined Concerns: Game logic, UI logic, and event handling are deeply
  mixed.
- Implicit State Machine: The currentPhase and conditional logic
  effectively form a state machine, but it's not explicit or easily
  manageable.
- Difficult to Test: Unit testing specific game logic is hard due to UI
  dependencies and global state.

  Assessment of Current Implementation Status:

  Upon reviewing the actual codebase, it's clear that significant refactoring
  work has already been completed or is in progress. The proposed modules
  largely already exist:

  ‚úÖ **Already Implemented:**
  - `battleStateMachine.js` - Exists and manages battle states/transitions
  - `roundResolver.js` - Exists and handles round outcome determination
  - `selectionHandler.js` - Exists and manages stat selection logic/timers
  - `roundUI.js` - Exists and handles UI updates for rounds
  - `orchestrator.js` - Exists and coordinates the battle flow

  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partially Implemented/Needs Refinement:**
  - The modules exist but may need better integration and clearer boundaries
  - Some responsibilities may still be duplicated between roundManager.js and the new modules
  - Event handling and state transitions could be more explicitly defined

  üîç **Accuracy Critique:**
  - The proposal accurately identifies the problems with the monolithic structure
  - However, it appears to be based on an older version of the codebase
  - The file structure diagram matches the current implementation
  - Benefits remain valid, but the implementation status needs updating

  Updated Refactoring Plan for Simplification:

  Given that much of the refactoring has already been implemented, the focus
  should shift to:

  1. **Complete the Separation of Concerns:**
      - Audit roundManager.js for any remaining responsibilities that should be moved
      - Ensure clean boundaries between orchestrator.js, roundManager.js, and other modules
      - Remove any duplicate logic between the modules

  2. **Strengthen the State Machine Integration:**
      - Ensure battleStateMachine.js is fully integrated with orchestrator.js
      - Verify all state transitions are properly handled and events emitted
      - Add explicit state validation and error handling

  3. **Refine Module Interfaces:**
      - Standardize how modules communicate (events vs direct calls)
      - Add proper error boundaries and fallback mechanisms
      - Ensure each module has clear, testable public APIs

  4. **Enhance Testing Infrastructure:**
      - Add integration tests for module interactions
      - Ensure unit tests can mock dependencies cleanly
      - Add performance tests for the refactored architecture

  5. **Update roundManager.js to Pure Orchestration:**
      - Remove any remaining business logic
      - Focus solely on coordinating module interactions
      - Add comprehensive error handling and recovery

  Current File Structure (Actual Implementation):

  src/helpers/classicBattle/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ roundManager.js // Still contains some logic, needs further refactoring
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orchestrator.js // Main coordinator (already exists)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ battleStateMachine.js // State management (already exists)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ roundUI.js // UI updates (already exists)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ selectionHandler.js // Stat selection (already exists)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ roundResolver.js // Round outcomes (already exists)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ eventBus.js // Event coordination (already exists)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other existing files)

  Opportunities for Improvement:

  1. **Complete the Extraction:**
      - Identify any remaining monolithic code in roundManager.js
      - Move timer management to a dedicated timerService.js (partially exists)
      - Extract sound effect handling to an audioService.js

  2. **Improve Module Communication:**
      - Standardize event naming conventions
      - Add request/response patterns for complex interactions
      - Implement proper error propagation between modules

  3. **Add Missing Abstractions:**
      - Create a configuration service for battle settings
      - Add a validation layer for state transitions
      - Implement a logging/monitoring service for debugging

  4. **Performance Optimizations:**
      - Add lazy loading for non-critical modules
      - Implement proper cleanup for event listeners and timers
      - Add memory leak prevention measures

  5. **Developer Experience:**
      - Add comprehensive JSDoc with @pseudocode for all public functions
      - Create clear migration guides for any breaking changes
      - Add runtime validation for module dependencies

  Implementation Priority:

  **High Priority (Immediate):**
  - Audit and remove duplicate logic between roundManager.js and new modules
  - Strengthen error handling and recovery mechanisms
  - Add integration tests for module interactions

  **Medium Priority (Next Sprint):**
  - Complete extraction of remaining responsibilities
  - Standardize communication patterns
  - Add performance monitoring

  **Low Priority (Future):**
  - Add advanced features like module hot-reloading for development
  - Implement A/B testing framework for battle mechanics
  - Add comprehensive end-to-end testing

  ***

  Success Metrics:

  - Reduce roundManager.js from 1370 lines to <500 lines
  - Achieve >90% test coverage for all new modules
  - Maintain or improve performance benchmarks
  - Zero regressions in existing functionality
  - Improved developer onboarding time

  ***

  Risk Assessment:

  **High Risk:**
  - State transition logic changes could break battle flow
  - Event handling changes could cause missed UI updates
  - Timer management changes could affect game pacing

  **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Implement comprehensive integration tests before changes
  - Add feature flags for gradual rollout
  - Maintain detailed change logs and rollback procedures
  - Conduct thorough manual testing of battle scenarios

  **Recommended Approach:**
  - Start with non-critical extractions (sound effects, logging)
  - Gradually move core logic while maintaining dual implementations
  - Use A/B testing to validate changes don't affect user experience
  - Have rollback plan ready for any critical issues

  This updated plan acknowledges the existing progress while providing a clear
  path forward to complete the refactoring and realize the full benefits of
  modular architecture.  Overall Benefits:

- Clearer Responsibilities: Each module has a single, well-defined purpose.
- Improved Testability: Smaller, focused modules are easier to unit test.
- Reduced Coupling: Changes in one area (e.g., UI) are less likely to
  impact others (e.g., game logic).
- Easier Debugging: Issues can be quickly isolated to a specific module.
- Enhanced Maintainability: The codebase becomes more modular and easier to
  understand for new developers.
- Better Performance: Enables lazy loading and targeted optimizations.
- Future-Proof: Easier to add new features or modify existing ones.

  This updated plan acknowledges the existing progress while providing a clear
  path forward to complete the refactoring and realize the full benefits of
  modular architecture. The focus should be on completing the separation of
  concerns, strengthening module integration, and adding comprehensive testing
  rather than starting from scratch.
