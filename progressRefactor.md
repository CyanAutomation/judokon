This roundManager.js file is indeed quite complex, acting as a central hub
for battle state, UI updates, event handling, and timer management. This
monolithic structure makes it hard to maintain, debug, and test.

Here's a breakdown of its current responsibilities and complexities,
followed by a proposed refactoring plan:

Current Responsibilities & Complexities:

1.  Battle State Management: Tracks currentRound, currentPhase, judoka data,
    selectedStat, etc. This state is extensive and intertwined with various
    functions.
2.  Game Flow Control: Manages the progression through battle phases (e.g.,
    STAT_SELECTION, ROUND_RESOLUTION, BATTLE_ENDED), including starting and
    ending rounds.
3.  UI Updates: Directly manipulates the DOM for round prompts, stat
    selection, scoreboard, snackbars, and battle results. This couples game
    logic with presentation.
4.  Event Handling: Subscribes to and dispatches numerous battle-related
    events, with complex logic within each handler.
5.  Timer Management: Handles multiple setTimeout and clearTimeout calls for
    countdowns and auto-selection, which are scattered and hard to track.
6.  Stat Selection Logic: Determines stat selection, handles user input, and
    implements auto-selection.
7.  Round Resolution Logic: Compares stats and determines the round winner.
8.  Sound Effects: Triggers various sound effects.

Key Issues:

- Monolithic: High coupling, making changes risky and understanding
  difficult.
- Intertwined Concerns: Game logic, UI logic, and event handling are deeply
  mixed.
- Implicit State Machine: The currentPhase and conditional logic
  effectively form a state machine, but it's not explicit or easily
  manageable.
- Difficult to Test: Unit testing specific game logic is hard due to UI
  dependencies and global state.

Proposed Refactoring Plan for Simplification:

The core idea is to apply the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and
separate concerns into distinct, testable modules.

1.  Introduce a Battle State Machine (`battleStateMachine.js`):
    - Purpose: Explicitly manage the battle's lifecycle and phases (e.g.,
      IDLE, BATTLE_STARTING, ROUND_STARTED, STAT_SELECTION,
      ROUND_RESOLUTION, BATTLE_ENDED).
    - Responsibility: Define states, transitions, and actions for each
      state. It would emit events when state changes occur.
    - Benefit: Provides a clear, visual representation of the game flow,
      making it easier to understand and debug.

2.  Extract Battle UI Manager (`battleUIManager.js`):
    - Purpose: Handle all UI-related updates and rendering.
    - Responsibility: Subscribe to events from the battleStateMachine and
      other game logic modules, then update the DOM accordingly (e.g.,
      showSnackbar, updateRoundPrompt, updateStatSelectionUI,
      updateScoreboard).
    - Benefit: Decouples game logic from presentation, allowing independent
      development and testing of UI.

3.  Encapsulate Stat Selection Logic (`statSelectionManager.js`):
    - Purpose: Manage the entire stat selection process.
    - Responsibility: Handle stat selection timers, user input for stat
      choice, and auto-selection logic. It would emit a STAT_SELECTED event
      upon completion.
    - Benefit: Isolates a complex piece of logic, making it more manageable
      and testable.

4.  Create a Round Resolver (`roundResolver.js`):
    - Purpose: Determine the outcome of a single round.
    - Responsibility: Take selected stats and judoka data, compare them,
      and return the round winner and result.
    - Benefit: Pure function, easily testable, and separates the "what
      happened" from the "how it happened."

5.  Refactor `roundManager.js` into an Orchestrator:
    - Purpose: Coordinate the interactions between the new, specialized
      modules.
    - Responsibility: Initialize the state machine, UI manager, stat
      selection manager, and event bus. It would subscribe to key events
      from these modules and trigger the next steps in the battle flow.
    - Benefit: Becomes much smaller, focusing solely on coordination rather
      than implementation details.

New File Structure (Example):

1 src/helpers/classicBattle/
2 ├── roundManager.js // Orchestrates the battle flow
3 ├── battleStateMachine.js // Manages battle states and
transitions
4 ├── battleUIManager.js // Handles all UI updates
5 ├── statSelectionManager.js // Manages stat selection and
timers
6 ├── roundResolver.js // Determines round outcomes
7 ├── eventBus.js // (Existing, but used more
effectively)
8 └── ... (other existing files)

Overall Benefits:

- Clearer Responsibilities: Each module has a single, well-defined purpose.
- Improved Testability: Smaller, focused modules are easier to unit test.
- Reduced Coupling: Changes in one area (e.g., UI) are less likely to
  impact others (e.g., game logic).
- Easier Debugging: Issues can be quickly isolated to a specific module.
- Enhanced Maintainability: The codebase becomes more modular and easier to
  understand for new developers.

This plan provides a clear path to significantly simplify roundManager.js. I
recommend starting with the battleStateMachine.js to establish the core flow,
then progressively extracting other concerns.
