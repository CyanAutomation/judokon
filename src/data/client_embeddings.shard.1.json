Fix any issues and rerun the checks until they all pass:\n\n```bash\nnpx prettier . --check # verify formatting\nnpx eslint . # lint the codebase\nnpx vitest run # run unit tests\nnpx playwright test # run Playwright UI tests\n```\n\n- Confirm that any new or modified functions include JSDoc with an `@pseudocode` block so documentation stays complete.\n- Playwright tests clear localStorage at startup. If a manual run fails unexpectedly, clear it in your browser and ensure [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) is served (start it with `npm start`).\n- Use `src/helpers/storage.js` for persistent data access instead of direct `localStorage` calls.\n- Use the shared scheduler (`src/utils/scheduler.js`) for all timing-sensitive work instead of standalone timers.\n","qaContext":"Why: ES modules without a build step.

Inside the error listener, define an asynchronous `task`:\\n            a. Obtain a fallback judoka.\\n            b. Generate a `fallbackCard` without appending it to the container.\\n            c. If `fallbackCard` is valid and the original `card` is still in the DOM, replace the original `card` with `fallbackCard`.\\n            d. If the original `card` is no longer in the DOM but its parent exists, append the `fallbackCard` to the parent.\\n            e. Catch and log any errors during the fallback swap.\\n         3. Push this `task` Promise into `pendingReplacements`.\\n      iii. Set `card.tabIndex` to 0 to make it focusable.\\n      iv. Set `card.setAttribute(\\\"role\\\", \\\"listitem\\\")`.\\n      v. Set `card.setAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\", card.getAttribute(\\\"data-judoka-name\\\") || \\\"Judoka card\\\")` using the judoka's name or a generic label.\\n      vi. Append the `card` to the `container`.\\n3. After the loop, define an asynchronous `ready` task that:\\n   a. Yields control to the event loop using `await Promise.resolve()` so synchronously dispatched image error events can register their tasks.\\n   b. Awaits all tasks in `pendingReplacements` with `Promise.allSettled()`.\\n4. Return an object containing the `ready` Promise.\\n\\nexport function appendCards(container, judokaList, gokyoLookup) {\\n  // Track any in-flight replacements triggered during this execution.\\n  const pendingReplacements = [];\\n\\n  const ready = (async () => {\\n    for (const judoka of judokaList) {\\n      let entry = judoka;\\n      if (!hasRequiredJudokaFields(judoka)) {\\n        console.error(\\\"Invalid judoka object:\\\", judoka);\\n        const missing = getMissingJudokaFields(judoka).join(\\\", \\\");\\n        console.error(`Missing fields: ${missing}`);\\n        entry = await getFallbackJudoka();\\n      }\\n      let card = await generateJudokaCard(entry, gokyoLookup, container);\\n      if (!card) {\\n        console.warn(\\\"Failed to generate card for judoka:\\\", entry);\\n        const fallback = await getFallbackJudoka();\\n        card = await generateJudokaCard(fallback, gokyoLookup, container);\\n      }\\n      if (card) {\\n        const img = card.querySelector(\\\"img\\\");\\n        if (img) {\\n          // Handle portrait load errors by swapping to a fallback card, but\\n          // do not block on image load events while building the carousel.\\n          img.addEventListener(\\n            \\\"error\\\",\\n            () => {\\n              // Start the replacement asynchronously and track it so that\\n              // appendCards can await if the error occurs before it returns.\\n              const task = (async () => {\\n                try {\\n                  const fallback = await getFallbackJudoka();\\n                  // Build a replacement card without auto-appending to container.\\n                  const fallbackCard = await generateJudokaCard(fallback, gokyoLookup);\\n                  if (fallbackCard) {\\n                    const parent = container || card.parentElement;\\n                    if (parent && parent.contains(card)) {\\n                      parent.replaceChild(fallbackCard, card);\\n                    } else if (parent) {\\n                      parent.appendChild(fallbackCard);\\n                    }\\n                  }\\n                } catch (err) {\\n                  console.error(\\\"Failed to swap to fallback card\\\", err);\\n                }\\n              })();\\n              pendingReplacements.push(task);\\n            },\\n            { once: true }\\n          );\\n        }\\n        card.tabIndex = 0;\\n        card.setAttribute(\\\"role\\\", \\\"listitem\\\");\\n        card.setAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\", card.getAttribute(\\\"data-judoka-name\\\") || \\\"Judoka card\\\");\\n        container.appendChild(card);\\n      }\\n    }\\n    // Give the event loop a turn so any synchronously dispatched image\\n    // error events can register tasks, then await them.\\n    await Promise.resolve();\\n    if (pendingReplacements.length) {\\n      await Promise.allSettled(pendingReplacements);\\n    }\\n  })();\\n\\n  return { ready };\\n}\",\"qaContext\":\"Why: Generate judoka cards and append them to the container.
