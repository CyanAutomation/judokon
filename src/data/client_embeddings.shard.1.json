Fix any issues and rerun the checks until they all pass:\n\n```bash\nnpx prettier . --check # verify formatting\nnpx eslint . # lint the codebase\nnpx vitest run # run unit tests\nnpx playwright test # run Playwright UI tests\n```\n\n- Confirm that any new or modified functions include JSDoc with an `@pseudocode` block so documentation stays complete.\n- Playwright tests clear localStorage at startup. If a manual run fails unexpectedly, clear it in your browser and ensure [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) is served (start it with `npm start`).\n- Use `src/helpers/storage.js` for persistent data access instead of direct `localStorage` calls.\n- Use the shared scheduler (`src/utils/scheduler.js`) for all timing-sensitive work instead of standalone timers.\n","qaContext":"Why: ES modules without a build step.
