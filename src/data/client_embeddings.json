single-column layout for mobile view (portrait resolution) - tiles stretch to 100% width with top and bottom padding - tile grid height equals `100dvh` minus the top and bottom bar heights (with a `100vh` fallback) so tiles always fill the viewport - add a small bottom margin so the tile grid does not touch the navigation bar on tablets - tap targets clearly bounded with shadow or color background - include visible focus outline for keyboard navigation -

**clarity and completeness:** a high-quality prd uses precise wording (no vague terms) and ensures nothing important is omitted. for example, it’s good practice to reference related prds (as in “see prd: team battle rules”) and to link dependencies. - **consistency:** use similar section headings and formatting across prds. the existing docs use headings like `## goals`, `## user stories`, `## functional requirements`, `## acceptance criteria`, etc. replicating these will help agents reliably parse and compare documents. - **examples from the codebase:** the classic battle prd (design/productrequirementsdocuments/prdbattleclassic.md) and browse judoka prd (prdbrowsejudoka.md) are good models. both include a prioritized requirements table followed by a bullet-list of acceptance criteria. ai agents can compare a new prd against these examples to see if key elements are present.","qaContext":"Why: the existing docs use headings like `## goals`, `## user stories`, `## functional requirements`, `## acceptance criteria`, etc. How: both include a prioritized requirements table followed by a...","embedding":[-0.093,-0.035,-0.127,-0.004,-0.044,0.071,0.046,0.082,0.022,-0.036,0.079,0.013,0.175,0.028,0.064,-0.006,0.094,-0.009,-0.077,0.038,0.042,-0.005,-0.008,0.032,-0.14,0.052,0.016,0.023,-0.096,0,0.045,0.058,0.02,0.072,0.026,0.052,0.01,-0.005,-0.119,-0.004,-0.146,0.012,-0.045,0.108,0.144,0.042,-0.069,-0.001,-0.048,0.109,-0.242,-0.032,-0.008,-0.061,0.087,0.093,0.063,-0.133,0.013,-0.157,0.017,-0.077,-0.049,0.001,-0.092,-0.026,-0.043,0.067,0.068,-0.006,-0.031,0.038,0.031,-0.016,-0.032,0.097,-0.022,-0.02,0.003,-0.203,-0.135,0.039,0.01,0.112,0.095,0.084,0.183,-0.034,-0.053,0.043,0.125,-0.057,0.155,-0.007,0.123,0.095,0.037,-0.169,-0.027,0.057,-0.064,0.042,0.014,-0.153,0.024,0.028,0.043,-0.055,0.02,-0.132,-0.039,-0.005,-0.124,-0.06,0.019,0.024,-0.13,-0.034,0.085,-0.041,-0.009,-0.029,-0.025,0.078,-0.018,0.046,-0.076,0,0.027,-0.074,-0.102,-0.008,-0.054,-0.024,-0.001,-0.079,-0.047,0.039,-0.061,0.135,-0.123,0.016,0.058,-0.04,-0.15,0.242,-0.106,0.038,0.019,-0.051,-0.015,-0.063,0.181,0.206,-0.025,-0.05,0.025,-0.002,-0.027,-0.072,-0.057,-0.107,-0.064,-0.007,-0.083,-0.108,-0.029,0.01,-0.05,-0.079,-0.061,-0.066,0.016,-0.045,-0.055,0.031,0.082,0.012,0.037,0.059,0.124,-0.082,-0.059,-0.189,-0.013,0.086,0.048,0.037,-0.09,0,0.003,0.161,0.025,0.094,-0.143,-0.008,0.125,-0.068,-0.091,-0.017,-0.033,-0.062,0.002,-0.131,-0.019,-0.038,0.008,-0.087,-0.234,0.118,-0.145,0.02,0.04,0.035,0.026,-0.146,-0.145,0.034,-0.005,0.045,-0.109,0.093,0.126,0,0.023,-0.026,0.026,0.052,-0.013,-0.054,-0.06,-0.048,0.127,-0.12,-0.066,-0.022,-0.054,-0.085,-0.031,-0.032,0.014,-0.043,-0.002,0.058,0.116,0.071,-0.085,0.071,-0.006,0.084,0.087,-0.113,0.009,-0.102,0.104,0.011,-0.123,0.08,-0.06,-0.127,0.014,-0.05,0.045,0.234,0.128,0.031,-0.048,0.073,-0.045,0.089,0.016,-0.001,0.083,-0.077,0.083,-0.025,0.006,-0.079,-0.157,-0.015,-0.047,-0.045,0.017,-0.011,-0.018,0.057,0.136,0.082,-0.01,-0.092,0.003,-0.072,-0.042,0.003,-0.066,0,-0.104,0.04,0.113,-0.005,-0.006,-0.027,0.055,0.022,-0.048,0.068,-0.004,0.062,0.019,0.274,-0.005,-0.022,0.044,0.065,-0.032,0.015,0.082,0.083,-0.084,0,-0.094,0.089,-0.026,0.036,-0.079,-0.08,-0.115,0.05,-0.106,-0.067,0.174,0.078,-0.198,-0.059,0.077,0.029,0.037,-0.046,-0.09,-0.013,0.045,-0.036,-0.066,0.117,-0.082,-0.008,0.065,0.083,0.093,0.035,0.215,-0.037,0.08,0.015,0.096,0.077,0.149,0.099,0.043,0.086,-0.021,-0.02,-0.061,0.008,-0.088,0.03,-0.058,-0.149,-0.06,-0.133,-0.054,-0.105,-0.034,0.078,-0.083,0.269,0.163,-0.058,0.055,0.001,0.134,0.082,-0.023,0.142],"sparseVector":{"arrow":1,"keys":1,"moves":1,"focus":1,"next":1,"card":1,"directly":1,"correspond":1,"features":1,"eg":1,"data":1,"binding":1,"accessibility":1,"easily":1,"checkable":1,"additional":1,"notes":1,"clarity":1,"completeness":1,"highquality":1,"prd":5,"uses":1,"precise":1,"wording":1,"vague":1,"terms":1,"ensures":1,"nothing":1,"important":1,"omitted":1,"example":1,"its":1,"good":2,"practice":1,"reference":1,"related":1,"prds":2,"see":2,"team":1,"battle":2,"rules":1,"link":1,"dependencies":1,"consistency":1,"use":2,"similar":1,"section":1,"headings":2,"formatting":1,"across":1,"existing":1,"docs":1,"like":1,"goals":1,"user":1,"stories":1,"functional":1,"requirements":2,"acceptance":2,"criteria":2,"etc":1,"replicating":1,"help":1,"agents":2,"reliably":1,"parse":1,"compare":2,"documents":1,"examples":2,"codebase":1,"classic":1,"designproductrequirementsdocumentsprdbattleclassicmd":1,"browse":1,"judoka":1,"prdbrowsejudokamd":1,"models":1,"include":1,"prioritized":1,"table":1,"followed":1,"bulletlist":1,"ai":1,"new":1,"key":1,"elements":1,"present":1},"source":"design/codeStandards/prdRulesForAgents.md [chunk 10]","tags":["prd","design-guideline","why","utility"],"metadata":{"role":"utility","patterns":[],"relations":{"imports":[],"calls":[]}},"version":1},
