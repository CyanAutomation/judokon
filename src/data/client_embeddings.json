This system supports AI agent workflows (e.g. QA, card generation, bug reproduction, test case creation) by enabling agents to search project data semantically.\n\nBy enabling faster and more accurate AI tooling, this feature indirectly enhances game quality and speed of delivery — leading to more balanced cards, faster bug fixes, and smoother releases for JU-DO-KON! players.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Statement / Why It Matters\n\nAs the JU-DO-KON! project scales, AI agents increasingly need to reason across scattered data sources (PRDs, JSON configs, tooltips). Current keyword-based methods are brittle, especially when terminology is inconsistent (e.g. “grip fighting” vs. “kumi-kata (grip fighting)”). This results in agents producing invalid queries or misclassifying design intents — e.g., test cases missing kumi-kata interactions due to synonyms not being recognized.\n\nWithout a semantic memory layer, agents must either parse entire documents from scratch or rely on hardcoded rules — both of which are inefficient and error-prone.\n\nUltimately, these issues increase the risk of bugs reaching players, slow down the delivery of new cards, and make it harder to maintain design consistency — all of which degrade the play experience for our core audience (kids ages 8–12).\n\n---\n\n## Goals / Success Metrics\n\n- Enable semantic search over project documentation and game data (e.g. PRDs, `judoka.json`, `tooltips.json`)\n- Improve agent self-sufficiency by reducing fallback to manual lookups by **30%** (measured via agent query logs)\n- Reduce use of hardcoded logic in prompt pipelines by **50%** across test agents\n- Provide consistent embedding format usable by in-browser tools or local dev agents\n\n**Success Metrics:**\n\n| Goal              | Metric                    ","qaContext":"PRD: Vector Database for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) ## TL;DR This PRD defines the implementation of a lightweight vector database for semantic sear...","embedding":[-0.0872,0.1067,-0.0708,-0.0014,0.0394,-0.023,0.0133,0.084,0.0804,0.0858,0.0469,-0.072,0.1033,0.0322,0.1122,0.0197,0.0984,0.1196,-0.1077,-0.008,0.1014,0.0584,0.0203,-0.0464,-0.107,0.0722,-0.0704,-0.087,-0.0977,-0.0221,0.0431,0.2073,-0.0542,0.1081,0.0192,0.0855,-0.0602,0.0389,-0.0541,-0.0886,-0.181,0.0779,-0.1397,-0.0074,0.1139,-0.0657,-0.0613,-0.0557,-0.0463,0.0734,-0.2449,-0.0762,0.0691,0.0306,0.0937,0.0628,0.01,0.0419,-0.0173,-0.0099,-0.0126,-0.1136,-0.0269,0.0091,0.0112,-0.1524,0.0779,-0.0213,0.0901,-0.0787,-0.0077,0.0867,-0.0614,0.0479,0.0258,0.1657,-0.0408,-0.0036,0.0258,-0.1998,-0.087,0.0015,-0.021,0.1034,-0.0057,-0.0148,0.1481,-0.0015,0.0995,-0.0113,0.0111,-0.0499,0.1696,-0.0145,0.0917,0.0422,0.0572,-0.1281,-0.0281,0.086,0.012,0.142,-0.0029,-0.0146,-0.0265,0.0308,0.0386,-0.0366,-0.0504,-0.0668,-0.0827,0.0462,-0.0516,-0.163,0.0689,-0.0395,-0.0656,0.0201,0.073,0.0859,0.119,-0.0012,-0.0094,0.0305,0.0986,0.1003,-0.1358,0,0.0733,-0.0539,-0.0487,0.0312,-0.0194,-0.1635,0.1041,0.0618,-0.0721,-0.0143,-0.0838,0.1641,-0.0867,0.076,0.1895,-0.0061,-0.1707,0.1118,-0.0163,0.0877,0.0932,-0.1249,0.0802,-0.0148,0.187,0.0731,-0.0005,-0.0502,0.0123,0.0164,-0.062,-0.1176,0.011,0.0412,-0.0863,0.0242,-0.0919,-0.0883,-0.0407,-0.003,-0.105,0.0104,-0.0349,-0.0568,0.0041,-0.0713,-0.0646,-0.0564,0.0132,-0.0278,0.081,0.094,0.1217,-0.0124,0.0104,-0.0255,0.0974,-0.0672,-0.059,0.1393,-0.0274,-0.0435,-0.009,0.1469,0.0437,0.0828,0.0351,0.1066,0.171,-0.0406,-0.0261,0.0693,0.0659,-0.0797,-0.0042,-0.201,0.0037,-0.094,-0.0597,-0.0918,-0.0501,0.033,-0.1336,0.0223,-0.0228,-0.0665,-0.0048,-0.1032,-0.0897,-0.0043,-0.0625,0.0039,-0.0958,0.1127,-0.0682,0,-0.0997,-0.1829,-0.1189,0.1405,-0.0019,-0.0832,0.0096,-0.0641,0.036,-0.1731,-0.1748,-0.0224,-0.0305,-0.0105,-0.0411,0.0667,-0.074,-0.053,0.003,0.1131,0.0536,0.2155,-0.1565,0.0014,0.0585,-0.0312,-0.0068,-0.0455,0.0079,-0.0356,0.0967,-0.0918,-0.1631,-0.0385,-0.0144,-0.0918,0.0283,-0.0122,-0.0698,0.1388,0.0071,0.0476,-0.1437,0.0111,-0.0204,0.079,-0.0841,0.0126,0.0885,-0.0005,0.1075,-0.0165,-0.009,-0.1042,-0.0806,-0.1007,-0.0275,-0.018,-0.068,0.0922,0.0027,-0.0729,0.0247,0.111,0.0363,-0.0259,-0.0844,0.0554,-0.1206,-0.0598,-0.0342,-0.0094,-0.0076,0.0674,0.0724,0.0512,-0.034,-0.0486,0.0498,0.0231,-0.0948,0.0238,0.0034,0.0652,-0.0536,0.192,-0.0351,0.083,0.0212,-0.0147,-0.0208,-0.0365,0.0031,0.1132,-0.0878,0,-0.0163,-0.0196,-0.0179,0.0327,0.0574,-0.0047,-0.0556,0.1673,-0.0221,-0.0366,0.1652,0.0866,-0.1226,0.0286,0.1258,0.0442,0.0033,0.0673,-0.1393,-0.0462,0.0677,0.1073,-0.1361,-0.0049,0.0433,-0.0863,-0.0004,0.0361,0.0759,-0.0028,0.0857,-0.0543,0.049,-0.0477,0.1774,0.1056,0.0627,0.0441,-0.0648,0.1786,-0.0087,0.0233,-0.0345,-0.0733,0.0325,-0.0075,-0.1941,-0.0528,0.0472,-0.0952,-0.1002,-0.0452,-0.1198,0.0469,0.1453,0.1095,0.0523,-0.0316,0.1234,0.0402,0.1451,0.0001,0.0008,0.106],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdVectorDatabaseRAG.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

The script at\n`scripts/generateEmbeddings.js` downloads the **quantized** `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model the first time it runs, so the command will fail without internet access. Cache the model locally or run it in an environment with a connection. Commit the updated `client_embeddings.json`—now pretty-printed for readability—so other agents work with the latest vectors. If you hit out-of-memory errors during generation, rerun the command with a higher heap limit (e.g. `node --max-old-space-size=8192 scripts/generateEmbeddings.js`). A GitHub Actions workflow could automate this\nregeneration whenever those folders change.\n\nThe generator parses JSON arrays and objects into individual snippets so each\nrecord receives its own embedding. For markdown sources, text is chunked from\none heading to the next heading of the same or higher level so each section is\nsemantically coherent. Tooltips, judoka entries, and PRD sections are broken\ndown into discrete blocks with unique IDs. This granularity improves lookup\naccuracy because search results map back to a single section or data row rather\nthan an entire file.\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [x] `client_embeddings.json` contains ≥6 fields per entry: `id`, `text`, optional `qaContext`, `embedding`, `source`, and optional `tags`\n- [x] `client_embeddings.json` stores the intent tag (`what`, `how`, or `why`) for each chunk\n- [x] Vector similarity function returns top 5 matches in ≤200ms on a mid-tier device (e.g. 2022 MacBook Air M1)\n- [x] Search works offline in a local browser with no server backend\n- [x] At least 30 unique content entries from across the PRDs/tooltips are indexed in the demo build\n- [x] Each returned result includes both th","qaContext":"| ### Embedding Refresh Pipeline After editing PRDs, tooltips, game rules, or any markdown under `design/codeStandards` or `design/agentWorkflows`, run `npm ...","embedding":[-0.1615,-0.0771,-0.0123,0.0254,0.1192,-0.12,-0.0886,-0.0131,0.0877,0.0123,0.0189,0.0971,0.0726,-0.0655,0.0263,0.0819,0.0569,0.0619,-0.0895,-0.0606,0.0125,0.025,0.0056,-0.0799,0.0132,0.028,-0.1022,-0.0147,-0.0619,-0.0373,0.057,0.0964,-0.0801,0.0767,0.0218,0.2246,-0.0012,-0.0597,-0.058,-0.0312,-0.007,0.0922,-0.0948,-0.0012,0.0507,-0.0848,-0.1076,-0.0861,-0.122,-0.0018,-0.1333,-0.0572,-0.086,0.0824,0.0578,0.0196,-0.01,0.0365,0.0045,0.0455,0.0351,-0.0936,0.0449,-0.0225,0.0676,-0.0687,0.0527,-0.0215,0.045,-0.0052,-0.0317,0.0811,-0.1682,-0.006,-0.0656,0.1102,0.0204,0.0168,0.0307,-0.1832,-0.046,-0.076,0.0134,0.0437,-0.0083,-0.0237,0.0692,0.0026,0.1013,0.054,-0.0626,-0.065,0.0828,0.0628,0.0357,0.0342,0.1047,-0.0086,0.0027,0.0856,0.0211,0.1067,0.0967,-0.037,0.0287,0.0197,0.016,0.1304,-0.1072,-0.0671,-0.042,0.0847,-0.0396,-0.0552,0.0236,0.0134,0.0815,-0.0163,-0.0015,0.1587,0.1092,0.0476,0.0222,-0.0233,0.0679,-0.0179,-0.0376,0,0.0916,-0.0981,-0.0329,0.008,0.1086,-0.0497,0.0299,0.0648,-0.139,0.0049,-0.0583,0.1574,-0.07,0.136,0.1097,-0.1341,-0.0117,0.0526,-0.0071,0.0342,0.0007,-0.0602,-0.0621,-0.0385,0.0408,0.08,0.0462,-0.0176,-0.1084,0.0086,-0.0885,-0.0329,-0.034,-0.0414,-0.0275,0.0282,-0.0726,-0.0959,-0.0776,-0.0792,0.0113,0.0668,-0.0887,-0.0971,-0.0711,-0.0955,-0.0711,0.0158,0.0299,0.0163,0.0634,0.0943,0.1003,-0.0189,-0.0029,-0.0657,0.0651,0.0039,0.0814,0.1685,0.0267,0.0216,-0.0013,0.0823,0.071,0.0333,0.059,0.0396,0.0599,0.1086,-0.0765,0.1255,0.1085,-0.0251,0.0498,-0.1832,-0.0928,-0.0623,-0.0483,-0.0881,-0.0194,-0.0155,-0.103,-0.009,-0.0245,-0.0487,-0.0129,-0.1276,-0.1525,-0.0194,0.0657,-0.0818,-0.0247,-0.0787,-0.0332,0,-0.0533,-0.1088,-0.0939,0.1787,-0.0539,-0.0863,-0.0434,0.0565,-0.0605,-0.1312,-0.099,0.0294,0.0063,-0.0698,0.0058,0.1106,-0.0736,-0.1642,0.0173,-0.0149,0.0293,0.1154,0.0135,0.091,0.032,0.0481,0.0125,0.0441,-0.0503,-0.1488,0.0165,-0.0385,-0.2283,-0.0382,-0.0029,-0.0954,-0.0003,0.0856,0.0216,0.0459,0.1634,0.0588,-0.1248,0.06,0.031,0.0412,-0.111,0.0416,0.0685,-0.0563,0.0391,-0.0352,-0.0349,-0.017,0.0216,-0.0724,-0.0819,0.0238,-0.0347,0.0077,0.0415,-0.0856,-0.0401,0.0211,0.0379,-0.0388,-0.0651,-0.0156,-0.0452,0.0027,0.0265,-0.0189,0.0315,-0.0312,0.0039,-0.0375,0.0764,-0.0912,0.003,0.0145,-0.099,0.1204,0.0275,0.0437,0.0356,0.0854,-0.0475,0.1342,0.0276,-0.013,-0.0096,0.0445,-0.0733,0.0649,-0.016,0,-0.0743,0.0691,-0.1383,0.044,0.049,0.0055,0.0146,0.1587,0.0314,-0.0542,0.2097,0.0132,-0.1067,0.0454,0.0626,0.0751,0.0156,0.0056,-0.1022,-0.0544,-0.0523,0.0905,-0.0266,0.0167,0.0208,-0.0711,0.1129,0.0923,0.0295,-0.0245,-0.0153,-0.0202,-0.001,-0.0587,0.0566,0.0468,0.0582,-0.056,0.0428,0.0781,0.0225,-0.02,0.0134,-0.0522,0.0422,-0.0347,-0.1075,0.019,0.0246,-0.0417,-0.0438,-0.068,-0.1327,0.0669,0.0729,-0.02,0.0141,-0.0873,0.1387,0.0163,0.0923,-0.0242,0.069,0.0394],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdVectorDatabaseRAG.md [chunk 5]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

This results in agents producing invalid queries or misclassifying design intents — e.g., test cases missing kumi-kata interactions due to synonyms not being recognized.\n\nWithout a semantic memory layer, agents must either parse entire documents from scratch or rely on hardcoded rules — both of which are inefficient and error-prone.\n\nUltimately, these issues increase the risk of bugs reaching players, slow down the delivery of new cards, and make it harder to maintain design consistency — all of which degrade the play experience for our core audience (kids ages 8–12).\n\n---","qaContext":"Problem Statement / Why It Matters As the JU-DO-KON!","embedding":[-0.0572,0.0309,-0.0106,0.0014,0.0016,0.0657,-0.0366,0.0304,0.0743,0.0468,0.0645,0.0079,0.0263,0.0323,0.1127,0.05,0.1305,0.0194,-0.0697,-0.0186,0.0986,0.0379,-0.0366,-0.0459,-0.0394,0.1156,-0.0746,-0.1171,0.0242,-0.0021,0.0442,0.2019,-0.0154,0.0877,0.0041,0.0713,-0.0646,0.0107,0.0115,-0.0412,-0.1106,0.0133,-0.1544,0.044,0.1564,-0.063,0.0139,-0.0569,-0.0092,0.0837,-0.2283,-0.0414,0.0706,-0.0079,0.0233,-0.0108,-0.0653,0.104,0.0283,0.0163,0.016,-0.0636,-0.0304,0.0725,0.0025,-0.1147,0.0574,-0.0301,0.0374,0.029,0.0512,0.0995,0.0757,0.035,0.0222,0.1334,-0.0223,-0.0878,0.0649,-0.1551,-0.0234,-0.0691,0.0553,0.0321,0.0525,0.0721,0.1156,-0.0758,-0.036,-0.0498,0.0326,-0.134,0.2475,-0.0228,0.0804,0.0995,-0.0624,-0.066,-0.0686,0.0861,-0.0342,0.1344,-0.0191,-0.004,-0.0276,-0.0386,0.0983,-0.0986,-0.0364,-0.0483,-0.0085,0.0658,-0.0072,-0.1157,0.0825,-0.0701,0.0104,0.0525,0.1129,0.1316,0.0366,-0.0548,0.0326,0.0661,0.0092,0.103,-0.0707,0,-0.0131,0.0075,-0.0129,0.042,-0.0147,-0.2028,0.0652,-0.0447,-0.0141,-0.0005,0.0278,0.0631,-0.0102,0.0626,0.1378,0.0638,-0.1638,0.0724,-0.0596,0.0165,0.1048,-0.1036,0.1108,0.0044,0.0087,0.0551,0.039,-0.0562,0.0686,0.0172,-0.0863,-0.0854,0.0427,0.084,-0.0897,0.099,-0.0381,-0.0882,-0.0532,-0.0533,-0.1201,0.0993,-0.0145,-0.1079,0.0274,-0.0196,-0.0541,-0.0685,-0.011,-0.0464,-0.0045,0.1338,0.1392,0.0358,0.0995,-0.0451,0.1172,-0.108,-0.04,0.0285,-0.01,-0.0672,0.0047,0.1952,0.0531,0.1687,0.0362,0.1036,0.0225,-0.1404,0.0041,0.0455,-0.1337,-0.0527,-0.0154,-0.1948,0.0172,-0.1551,-0.0262,-0.0904,-0.0253,0.0151,-0.087,0.1366,-0.1405,-0.0232,-0.0329,-0.0371,0.0354,0.0606,-0.0468,0.014,-0.0428,0.0181,-0.0324,0,-0.0839,-0.1364,-0.1445,0.0999,-0.0689,-0.1102,-0.0102,-0.0395,0.1718,-0.0812,-0.0639,-0.0352,-0.0638,-0.0783,0.0112,-0.0872,-0.0521,-0.0387,0.0721,0.0221,0.1139,0.0456,-0.125,0.0125,0.1124,0.0098,-0.0328,-0.0167,-0.0508,-0.0262,0.0571,-0.1025,-0.0708,0.0086,-0.0319,0.0316,-0.0384,0.056,-0.0131,0.065,-0.0097,0.0338,-0.1537,0.0383,-0.0386,0.0031,-0.0586,0.0571,0.0997,-0.0117,0.0674,-0.03,-0.0878,-0.2266,-0.1214,0.0076,0.0486,-0.0658,-0.1352,0.0238,-0.0624,-0.0468,0.0204,-0.0025,-0.037,-0.0611,-0.0858,0.08,-0.0161,-0.0791,-0.0199,-0.0168,-0.1243,0.1144,0.006,0.0539,0.0302,-0.0486,0.0474,-0.0244,-0.017,0.0235,-0.0062,0.0558,0.0688,0.1711,-0.0276,-0.0003,-0.0207,0.0012,0.0168,-0.0013,0.0399,0.0762,-0.229,0,-0.0378,0.0287,0.029,0.0372,-0.0578,-0.011,-0.0304,0.07,0.0207,-0.0347,0.1781,0.0502,-0.0956,0.0281,0.0723,0.0311,0.0028,0.0326,-0.1274,-0.0616,0.0323,0.0537,-0.1182,-0.0161,0.0428,0.0109,-0.0486,0.0674,-0.0243,0.0802,0.0474,0.0537,0.0296,0.0408,0.0872,0.1198,0.0719,0.0669,-0.0638,0.0311,-0.0388,-0.0513,-0.0614,-0.0098,0.0508,0.017,-0.1092,-0.072,0.1176,-0.0752,-0.1408,-0.0284,-0.0769,0.0705,0.1988,0.0868,0.0735,-0.0536,0.1267,-0.0084,0.0863,0.0047,-0.0116,0.0763],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdVectorDatabaseRAG.md [chunk 11]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

The script at\n`scripts/generateEmbeddings.js` downloads the **quantized** `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model the first time it runs, so the command will fail without internet access. Cache the model locally or run it in an environment with a connection. Commit the updated `client_embeddings.json`—now pretty-printed for readability—so other agents work with the latest vectors. If you hit out-of-memory errors during generation, rerun the command with a higher heap limit (e.g. `node --max-old-space-size=8192 scripts/generateEmbeddings.js`). A GitHub Actions workflow could automate this\nregeneration whenever those folders change.\n\nThe generator parses JSON arrays and objects into individual snippets so each\nrecord receives its own embedding.

Surface the message “Embeddings could not be loaded – please check console.”\n- **Corrupted JSON File**: Show a fallback message and prevent crashes; disable the query interface if JSON fails to parse.\n- **Out-of-Vocabulary Query**: If no results meet the similarity threshold, the UI remains usable and displays “No close matches found.”\n- **Version Mismatch**: Add a version field to the JSON file (e.g., `\"version\": \"v1.0\"`) a","qaContext":"Acceptance Criteria - [x] `client_embeddings.","embedding":[-0.1628,0.0287,-0.0126,0.0357,0.155,-0.0372,-0.0559,0.0212,0.0623,-0.0607,0.0586,-0.001,0.1285,-0.0329,0.0285,0.0461,0.0701,-0.017,-0.0619,0.0022,0.01,0.067,0.0209,-0.0771,0.0004,0.0132,-0.1293,0.0224,-0.0755,0.0182,0.0595,0.1453,-0.0465,0.1303,0.059,0.0096,-0.032,-0.0947,-0.0806,-0.1334,-0.0361,0.0738,-0.0886,0.1282,0.0063,-0.1124,-0.1961,-0.1032,-0.0696,0.0477,-0.1695,-0.0173,-0.1083,0.11,0.0844,0.022,-0.1644,0.0348,-0.0209,0.0884,0.0232,-0.0909,0.0368,0.0449,0.0239,-0.0565,-0.0117,-0.0968,0.073,-0.0004,-0.0417,0.031,-0.1944,0.0381,-0.0418,0.0999,0.0018,-0.067,-0.0798,-0.165,-0.097,-0.0617,-0.0162,0.0583,0.0329,-0.038,0.0754,-0.0596,0.0793,0.0556,-0.0242,-0.1253,0.0767,0.0158,0.074,0.0223,0.0935,0.0244,-0.0226,0.1276,-0.0235,0.0489,0.1214,-0.0296,0.0221,-0.0296,0.0451,0.0403,-0.0218,-0.084,-0.0972,0.0197,-0.0321,-0.1075,0.0099,0.0137,0.139,0.0393,0.0545,0.1309,0.0889,0.0185,-0.0377,-0.08,0.0162,-0.0291,-0.0397,0,0.0741,-0.1017,-0.056,-0.0373,0.0833,-0.0998,0.0218,0.1087,-0.1497,0.0486,-0.0749,0.1798,-0.0712,0.0935,0.0677,-0.0847,-0.0154,0.0942,-0.0008,0.044,0.0451,-0.137,-0.0435,-0.0403,0.0471,0.0607,0.0066,-0.0585,-0.0425,0.0252,-0.1284,-0.0705,0.0213,-0.1172,-0.0076,-0.0081,-0.0719,-0.0775,-0.0562,-0.1074,-0.11,-0.0167,-0.091,-0.1431,-0.0095,-0.0912,-0.1021,-0.038,0.0148,0.0094,0.0721,0.0875,0.0422,-0.0242,0.0032,-0.1002,0.0311,0.0587,0.0362,0.1385,0.0719,-0.0077,0.0137,-0.012,0.0102,0.0293,0.0765,0.0115,-0.049,0.116,-0.064,0.0405,0.0814,-0.0415,0.0307,-0.2069,-0.1128,-0.0219,0.025,-0.091,-0.0291,-0.0806,-0.0616,0.0032,-0.0822,-0.0637,0.0808,-0.1855,-0.12,0.0133,0.0709,0.0223,-0.1131,-0.0552,0.0084,0,-0.0396,-0.1511,-0.0479,0.0323,-0.0754,-0.0545,0.1031,0.1163,0.0037,-0.1039,-0.0461,0.011,0.0487,-0.1329,-0.0762,0.1948,-0.1124,-0.0874,-0.0306,0.0889,0.0148,0.0891,0.0031,0.0919,0.046,0.0136,0.1027,0.0247,-0.0683,-0.2029,0.0886,-0.0317,-0.2315,-0.1168,0.0269,-0.0682,0.0643,0.0809,-0.0502,0.0985,0.1693,0.0821,-0.0927,0.1012,0.0278,-0.0021,-0.0314,0.0336,0.1208,-0.0666,0.0961,0.0007,0.0154,-0.0054,0.0085,-0.0509,-0.071,0.0383,-0.0559,-0.0023,0.0918,-0.1069,-0.0839,0.0199,0.1314,-0.0648,-0.0821,0.069,-0.0444,0.0387,0.0196,-0.0804,0.0149,-0.0461,0.053,0.0469,0.1117,-0.0545,0.0067,0.0197,-0.0249,0.1481,0.0364,0.0624,0.0201,0.0869,-0.0398,0.1957,-0.0145,0.0126,-0.0338,0.0147,-0.0732,0.09,0.0118,0,-0.137,-0.028,-0.1242,0.0082,0.0748,0.0931,0.0064,0.071,0.004,-0.0469,0.1634,0.0001,-0.1999,0.0477,0.0357,0.0421,-0.0361,0.0443,-0.0567,0.0155,-0.0297,0.1371,-0.0574,-0.0489,0.028,0.0078,0.0249,0.1596,0.0197,-0.011,0.003,-0.0331,-0.0431,-0.1325,0.0287,0.1176,0.0178,-0.0415,-0.0444,0.0752,0.0961,-0.0039,0.0005,-0.0378,0.0576,0.0025,0.0211,0.0057,0.0488,-0.0558,0.0033,-0.1645,-0.0572,0.0455,-0.0042,-0.0397,0.0489,-0.0347,0.1659,-0.0216,0.1872,-0.0024,0.129,0.1313],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdVectorDatabaseRAG.md [chunk 18]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdVectorDatabaseRAG.md-chunk-20","text":"## Design and UX Considerations\n\n- A simple web UI mockup is shown below.\n- Must work offline within GitHub Pages without requiring server-side infrastructure.\n- When testing locally, serve the repository with `npm start` so the search page can fetch Markdown context files.\n- Vector format must be JSON-serializable and readable by JavaScript.\n- Embedding dimensionality must be ≤384 for performance.\n- UI must support keyboard navigation and screen readers.\n- Tap/click targets should be at least 44px height for accessibility.\n- Lookup responses must render within 200ms; show loading spinner if delayed.\n- Display an error message when embeddings or the model fail to load.\n- Show up to five matches with score, source, and tags information. Each entry displays its optional `qaContext` snippet beneath the match text.\n- Search results appear in a responsive table with alternating row colors for readability.\n- The Match column is wider than Source, Tags, and Score, which are sized smaller to save space.\n- Paths in the Source column break onto new lines at each `/` so long file names remain legible.\n- Long match snippets are truncated after roughly 200 characters with a\n  \"Show more\" button that expands the full text within the table row.\n- Embeddings load automatically when the page initializes so the first search runs immediately.\n- Matches scoring at least `0.6` are considered strong. When the top match is\n  more than `0.4` higher than the next best score, only that top result is\n  displayed.\n- Scores are normalized to the 0–1 range. Exact term matches (case-insensitive)\n  receive a small `+0.1` bonus before sorting to promote literal keyword hits.\n- Query text is expanded using `src/data/synonyms.json` so common phrases and near\n  spellings map to canonical technique names.\n- Lower scoring results appear only when there are no strong matches.\n- Result messages such as \"No strong matches found…\" should use the `.search-result-empty` CSS class.

{"id":"prdUpdateJudoka.md-chunk-21","text":"## UI Design\n\n**Feedback & Modal Layer**  \n_Contents:_\n\n- Modular status/confirmation bar above Save button, with slide-up and fade animation for both success and conflict messages\n- Inline validation error area directly under each editable stat/appearance field (auto-expanding, 200ms fade)\n- Reusable modal overlay component for error/retry, loading spinner, and edit-locked state, with focus trap and dismiss/OK button\n\n_Why:_  \nYour current design provides zero feedback for success, error, or locked states, in direct violation of nearly every requirement and game state. Modularizing feedback and overlays ensures every edge case is handled and future features can be slotted in without redesigning the whole screen.\n\n---\n\n**Responsive & Touch-Optimized Form Module**  \n_Contents:_\n\n- All editable fields refactored into clearly labeled, interactive controls (sliders or steppers for stats, dropdowns for Gi/Belt, tappable avatar tiles for Hairstyle)\n- Minimum 44px vertical height per input for touch targets\n- Logical, single-column flow with clear focus order, tab/keyboard support, and section dividers for Stats/Appearance\n- Flexible width—auto-scaling to screen size, using grid or flexbox\n\n_Why:_  \nCurrent controls are static and too small for any touch or keyboard user. Responsive, interactive controls are non-negotiable for a modern web game UI.\n\n---\n\n**Header & Action Bar Module**  \n_Contents:_\n\n- Consistent header with dominant title, smaller back button, and safe padding\n- Save/Cancel action bar pinned at the bottom, grouped together, with Save as primary (high contrast color) and clear disabled state if form invalid\n- Optional: floating help/info button for future accessibility hints\n\n_Why:_  \nHeader and action layout are inconsistent, cluttered, and violate basic navigation standards. Centralizing actions at the bottom with proper grouping reduces confusion and supports touch ergonomics.\n\n---","qaContext":"UI Design **Feedback & Modal Layer** _Contents:_ - Modular status/confirmation bar above Save button, with slide-up and fade animation for both success and c...","embedding":[-0.1096,0.0481,-0.0113,0.0181,0.0694,0.03,-0.0145,0.1087,-0.0358,0.0533,0.0396,0.0121,0.0256,-0.027,0.0232,0.05,0.1067,-0.0079,-0.0991,0.0298,0.0808,-0.0632,0.0536,-0.0189,-0.1119,0.0537,-0.0701,0.0401,-0.0203,-0.1369,-0.0335,0.1083,-0.0176,-0.027,-0.1425,-0.0718,0.0424,-0.022,-0.1023,-0.1361,-0.1449,-0.0246,0.0002,0.0726,-0.0487,-0.0654,-0.0334,-0.0677,-0.0541,0.0599,0.0265,-0.1034,0.1126,0.0574,0.0433,0.0031,0.0008,0.0265,0.0091,0.0404,0.0407,0.0263,0.0312,0.0164,0.0532,0.0797,-0.021,-0.127,0.0312,-0.073,-0.0591,-0.0892,-0.0223,-0.0298,-0.0032,-0.1039,-0.0826,0.0251,-0.0556,-0.0124,0.0383,0.0525,0.0151,-0.0131,0.0299,-0.0381,0.0259,0.0447,-0.0066,-0.0109,-0.0061,0.0365,0.0129,0.0127,0.0078,-0.0249,-0.0427,-0.1172,-0.1196,0.0652,0.0266,-0.033,0.0741,0.0205,0.0303,-0.0467,0.0147,0.0595,-0.1104,0.0431,-0.0494,-0.0489,-0.0815,-0.0442,0.0862,-0.0631,0.0086,0.065,0.1251,0.0089,0.1026,0.0386,-0.0756,-0.0772,0.1069,-0.0454,-0.0914,0,0.0533,0.0542,-0.1382,0.1159,0.0461,0.0671,0.0333,-0.0045,-0.026,-0.0195,0.0707,0.0329,-0.0976,0.0677,0.174,-0.1596,-0.002,0.049,0.0054,-0.0328,0.0172,0.017,-0.0076,0.0622,0.0578,0.0579,0.0303,0.0651,-0.1278,-0.0254,-0.0973,-0.0804,0.0358,-0.0786,-0.0035,-0.0118,-0.053,-0.1299,0.0235,-0.0189,-0.1575,-0.0101,-0.0669,0.0223,0.0245,-0.0107,0.0714,-0.0111,-0.0383,0.026,-0.0234,0.0229,0.0222,-0.0489,0.0133,-0.0778,0.0213,0.0412,0.0377,0.0844,0.0052,-0.0307,-0.1334,-0.0467,-0.0541,0.1202,-0.0106,-0.013,0.0302,-0.0725,-0.141,0.0384,0.0937,0.0874,0.0114,-0.1214,-0.0034,-0.1095,-0.0413,-0.0424,-0.0151,0.0292,-0.0485,0.0896,-0.0089,-0.1187,0.0595,0.0276,-0.1304,-0.0065,-0.0937,-0.0107,0.0745,0.0155,-0.0267,0,-0.0159,-0.0522,-0.1234,0.0759,-0.0073,0.0387,0.0667,0.0575,0.0291,-0.1251,-0.0069,0.0745,0.0019,-0.0137,-0.1188,0.1344,-0.1278,-0.049,0.0074,-0.0256,0.1223,0.1193,-0.0669,0.0023,-0.0749,0.021,-0.0325,0.0176,0.1182,0.0138,0.0425,-0.0702,0.03,-0.0214,0.073,-0.0578,0.0026,-0.052,-0.0444,0.0209,0.0531,-0.0013,0.0332,0.0189,0.0361,0.0768,0.003,-0.0218,-0.1241,-0.0038,-0.0407,-0.0453,-0.0547,-0.0505,0.0155,-0.0437,0.0214,-0.0245,0.0213,-0.0182,0.0614,0.0465,-0.0184,-0.0048,0.0948,0.0607,0.0201,-0.0195,0.0878,0.0718,-0.0318,-0.0203,0.061,-0.0942,0.0929,0.0199,0.1092,-0.045,0.0374,-0.0423,-0.0657,0.0415,0.0567,-0.0499,0.0046,0.1335,-0.0696,0.1211,0.0469,0.006,-0.0539,0.0296,0.1116,0.0525,0.0192,0,0.0147,0.0193,0.015,-0.099,0.0605,-0.0174,0.0568,-0.0579,0.0295,-0.0291,0.1151,0.0437,-0.102,0.0109,0.0248,0.1044,-0.0543,0.19,-0.0596,-0.0516,0.0651,-0.0129,-0.0527,0.0059,0.0219,0.0075,-0.0836,0.0992,-0.0176,-0.0032,0.0537,-0.0685,0.0879,-0.0139,-0.1003,0.0175,-0.0268,0.0195,0.0798,0.0569,0.0107,-0.0955,-0.0491,0.0263,0.0317,0.0435,-0.0296,-0.1054,-0.073,-0.0302,-0.0864,0.01,-0.032,0.1023,0.0653,0.1109,0.0399,0.0321,0.0997,-0.064,0.0971,0.0396,-0.0112,0.0399],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdUpdateJudoka.md [chunk 21]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdTooltipViewer.md-chunk-1","text":"# PRD: Tooltip Viewer\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThe **Tooltip Viewer** is a standalone HTML page that enables team members — including content editors, developers, and QA testers — to browse and inspect all tooltip entries from `tooltips.json`. It features a left-hand list of tooltip keys (e.g., `stat.power`, `ui.selectStat`) and a right-hand preview panel displaying tooltip content with both rendered formatting and raw text. This viewer facilitates faster editing cycles, more consistent copy, and easier QA workflows across the JU-DO-KON! project.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Statement / Why It Matters\n\nThe JU-DO-KON! tooltip system relies on `tooltips.json`, but there’s currently no way to preview or validate tooltips outside live gameplay. This creates pain points in several workflows:\n\n- **Content editors** struggle to review copy or ensure tone consistency without touching code or UI.\n- **QA testers** must navigate multiple screens to find tooltip render errors or omissions.\n- **Developers** need to verify correct key usage and markdown output, often through time-consuming builds.\n\nDuring v0.7, a typo in `stat.focus` persisted through 3 releases due to lack of preview tools. As the tooltip set grows (>500 entries), copy drift and formatting bugs become more likely and harder to detect.\n\n---\n\n## Goals / Success Metrics\n\n| Goal Description                                                                 | Metric                                 | Target              |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |\n| Allow team members to browse all tooltip entries without touching the game code | Tooltip Viewer accessibility rate      | 100%                |\n| Reduce tooltip-related QA errors pre-deployment                                 | Tooltip-related bug count              | ↓ 50% per release   |\n| Provide previews styled as in-game                                              | Renderin","qaContext":"PRD: Tooltip Viewer ## TL;DR The **Tooltip Viewer** is a standalone HTML page that enables team members — including content editors, developers, and QA teste...","embedding":[-0.2173,0.0088,-0.0414,0.0653,0.1284,0.0054,0.0578,0.004,0.1547,0.0236,0.0043,-0.0599,0.0151,-0.0023,-0.0235,-0.0224,0.0598,-0.1316,-0.0696,-0.0354,0.0179,-0.0412,0.0827,0.0752,0.0136,0.0394,-0.1591,0.0454,-0.0805,-0.0568,-0.1467,0.1,-0.0971,-0.0471,0.1167,0.0677,0.057,-0.0172,-0.0024,-0.0273,-0.098,0.0432,-0.121,-0.0382,0.0549,-0.1784,-0.0337,-0.1386,0.0102,0.1598,-0.1078,-0.0868,0.0905,-0.0677,0.1124,0.0739,0.0176,-0.0645,0.0574,0.0866,-0.0159,0.0386,0.0432,0.029,0.0454,0.0362,0.0095,-0.0184,-0.0604,-0.0777,-0.069,-0.0409,-0.0013,-0.0008,0.0302,0.0605,-0.1247,-0.0317,-0.0865,-0.2081,0.0521,0.0062,-0.0251,0.1056,-0.0183,0.0513,0.0887,-0.0166,0.0433,0.0411,-0.037,-0.0912,0.0697,-0.0159,0.0615,0.0149,0.0188,-0.0906,-0.0766,0.1095,0.052,-0.0753,0.0443,-0.1213,-0.0007,0.0207,0.0475,0.0104,-0.1392,0.0071,0.0367,0.03,-0.0856,-0.0893,0.0052,-0.1065,0.0624,0.0125,0.066,0.0991,0.1452,0.0061,-0.0566,0.0177,0.2086,0.0962,-0.0203,0,0.1678,-0.0642,-0.0483,-0.0292,-0.0044,-0.0268,0.0335,0.0094,-0.1311,-0.1335,0.0906,0.0636,-0.028,-0.0706,0.0199,-0.0015,-0.0501,0.0818,-0.1015,0.0072,0.0117,-0.1944,-0.0188,0.0098,0.0707,0.129,-0.0516,0.0784,-0.043,0.0299,-0.0947,-0.0102,0.0923,-0.1026,-0.1532,0.0305,-0.0457,-0.1242,0.0346,0.0008,-0.0691,-0.034,0.0134,-0.0852,-0.0426,0.0429,-0.1217,0.0613,0.0373,-0.0643,-0.0793,0.0821,0.0848,0.0291,0.079,-0.0339,0.0945,-0.067,0.0561,0.0668,-0.0079,0.1506,-0.1195,-0.0476,-0.0081,0.08,-0.031,0.0933,0.0571,-0.0777,-0.1042,0.0035,0.0558,0.1349,0.0817,-0.2058,-0.0354,-0.047,0.1131,-0.0938,0.0625,-0.0894,0.0338,-0.0599,-0.0098,-0.2134,0.0367,-0.0779,-0.2,-0.0033,-0.0162,-0.0037,-0.0721,-0.02,-0.1994,0,-0.018,-0.0409,-0.0683,0.1344,-0.0364,0.002,-0.0819,-0.089,0.1142,-0.081,-0.0432,-0.0015,-0.1454,-0.0323,-0.0058,0.0664,-0.11,-0.0498,0.0343,-0.046,0.071,0.0269,0.0122,0.1087,-0.0788,-0.0814,0.0633,-0.0015,-0.0541,-0.107,0.0498,-0.0594,-0.1646,-0.1356,0.0547,-0.1108,0.0468,-0.0544,-0.0013,0.2079,0.16,-0.0296,-0.0021,-0.0331,-0.049,0.0768,-0.04,-0.0657,0.0301,0.0368,0.0883,-0.0611,0.0099,-0.0567,-0.1098,-0.1096,-0.0755,0.0125,-0.0462,0.0316,0.0644,-0.0597,-0.1065,0.1515,0.0928,-0.0622,0.0385,0.0569,0.0388,-0.0394,-0.0047,-0.117,0.0868,-0.138,0.0729,0.0789,-0.0019,-0.0934,0.0803,-0.1074,0.0243,-0.0302,0.0934,-0.0141,-0.0268,0.1589,-0.0454,0.1419,-0.0577,0.0399,-0.0312,-0.0617,0.0874,0.0473,0.0547,0,0.0459,0.1302,-0.078,-0.0413,0.0137,-0.0138,0.0178,0.0587,0.0692,-0.0071,0.0744,0.0378,-0.0951,-0.0082,0.0225,0.0874,-0.105,0.1465,-0.0974,-0.0485,0.061,0.088,-0.0788,-0.0675,-0.0519,-0.025,-0.0882,0.1264,0.0472,-0.0063,0.0643,-0.0151,-0.0873,-0.0198,0.0122,-0.0155,0.0346,0.0461,0.1084,0.2245,-0.0916,-0.0457,-0.1806,-0.0423,-0.0777,-0.0232,-0.0885,-0.06,-0.0684,-0.129,-0.0575,-0.0656,-0.0215,0.0487,0.0213,0.0235,0.1145,0.1037,0.1016,0.0192,0.0941,-0.0286,0.054,0.189],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdTooltipViewer.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

Desktop: Sidebar (left, 35%) + Preview Pane (right, 65%)\n- Mobile: Sidebar stacks above preview (≤600px)\n- Smooth transitions when resizing\n\n### Animations & Interactivity\n\n- Clicked key animates with highlight (fade-in + border pulse, 150ms)\n- Preview panel fades in (100ms delay) on selection\n- Search box debounced (300ms) to avoid lag during input\n\n### Accessibility\n\n- All

This creates pain points in several workflows:\n\n- **Content editors** struggle to review copy or ensure tone consistency without touching code or UI.\n- **QA testers** must navigate multiple screens to find tooltip render errors or omissions.\n- **Developers** need to verify correct key usage and markdown output, often through time-consuming builds.\n\nDuring v0.7, a typo in `stat.focus` persisted through 3 releases due to lack of preview tools.

{"id":"prdTooltipSystem.md-chunk-1","text":"# PRD: Tooltip System (JU-DO-KON!)\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThe Tooltip System introduces dynamic, in-context guidance across JU-DO-KON! using a flexible JSON-driven approach. By attaching a `data-tooltip-id` attribute to UI elements and rendering markdown-formatted text from a central `tooltips.json` file, the system allows players to receive concise, context-aware explanations during gameplay. This improves accessibility, player comprehension, and overall user experience, especially for younger or first-time users.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Statement / Why It Matters\n\nNew or less experienced players may not understand what certain game elements represent — such as unfamiliar stats (e.g. Kumi-kata (grip fighting)), game modes, or buttons — leading to confusion or disengagement. User feedback and playtest sessions have highlighted the need for clear in-context guidance:\n\n> “I didn’t know what Kumi-kata (grip fighting) meant. I just picked the highest number.” — playtester, age 11\n\nCurrently, JU-DO-KON! has no way of surfacing explanatory text in the UI without hardcoding strings or duplicating content. This limits future extensibility, localization, and scalability of user help content.\n\n**Why now**: As JU-DO-KON! expands its stat complexity and introduces new game modes, the barrier to entry for new players increases. Immediate in-context help is essential to prevent player drop-off and encourage exploration.\n\n---\n\n## Goals / Success Metrics\n\n- Increase correct stat usage decisions by new players by 20% during their first 3 battles.\n- Maintain consistent, scalable tooltips across the app from a single source of truth.\n- Enable developers to implement tooltips in any part of the UI with a simple HTML attribute.\n- Load and display tooltips in under 150ms on first hover.\n- Render basic formatting (bold, italics, line breaks) without manual HTML.\n\n---\n\n## User Stories\n\n- As a new player, I want to understand what a stat like Power or Kumi-kata (grip fighting) means so that I can make better ","qaContext":"PRD: Tooltip System (JU-DO-KON!","embedding":[-0.1274,0.1003,0.0439,-0.0005,0.085,0.0398,0.2038,0.1106,0.0959,0.0157,0.0689,-0.1101,0.0461,0.0364,0.1358,-0.0157,0.1089,0.0677,-0.1592,-0.0424,0.1129,-0.0635,0.1031,0.0205,-0.0536,0.0785,-0.0866,0.0528,-0.0444,0.007,-0.0711,0.1844,0.0399,-0.0613,-0.1271,0.0374,0.0168,0.1058,-0.0917,-0.061,-0.1525,0.067,-0.0557,0.0332,0.0726,-0.0856,-0.0672,-0.0828,-0.0176,0.181,-0.1104,-0.0441,0.0918,-0.0926,0.1524,0.0602,-0.0048,0.1,0.0431,0.0933,-0.047,-0.0502,0.0046,0.0748,0.0786,-0.1064,0.0735,-0.0116,-0.0851,-0.0257,-0.0179,0.0132,0.0722,0.0472,0.034,0.0613,-0.1843,-0.0216,-0.0621,-0.0837,0.0603,0.0925,-0.029,0.0556,-0.0659,-0.0107,0.0867,-0.048,0.012,0.0577,-0.0418,-0.0542,0.0479,-0.0046,0.0623,0.0749,-0.0031,-0.0454,-0.1333,0.1204,0.0543,0.0696,0.0597,-0.0601,0.0206,-0.0384,-0.0542,-0.0503,-0.1327,0.0108,0.0304,-0.0039,-0.1725,-0.0681,0.0993,-0.0529,0.0987,0.0058,0.1401,0.1005,0.1743,-0.0365,-0.0773,0.0444,0.1343,0.0874,-0.0716,0,0.1589,-0.0841,0.0006,0.1379,-0.0497,-0.1313,-0.0634,-0.0534,-0.0829,-0.0248,0.0635,0.1952,-0.0368,-0.0138,0.1612,-0.0157,-0.1257,0.0175,0.0063,-0.0033,0.0796,-0.088,0.0043,-0.0512,0.0645,0.1122,0.0619,0.0037,-0.0486,-0.0066,-0.0975,-0.1179,-0.0115,-0.0747,-0.0793,-0.0137,0.0013,-0.1774,-0.0261,-0.0854,-0.0529,-0.0125,-0.0778,-0.025,-0.1106,-0.0318,-0.041,-0.0314,-0.0827,0.031,-0.0888,0.0601,0.1618,-0.047,0.0565,-0.0014,0.037,-0.106,-0.0492,0.0754,0.0117,-0.0079,-0.0434,0.1382,-0.019,0.0732,-0.0472,0.0397,0.0691,-0.1162,-0.1372,0.0855,0.0304,0.0359,0.0239,-0.1407,-0.0388,-0.0791,-0.0388,-0.0707,0.0998,-0.0784,-0.1075,0.0744,-0.0198,-0.0657,0.0726,-0.1408,-0.1814,-0.0875,-0.041,-0.0319,-0.0816,0.0231,-0.1162,0,0.0083,-0.0369,-0.0617,0.0727,0.065,0.0096,0.0238,-0.0179,0.0693,-0.1706,-0.1175,0.0309,-0.0909,-0.034,0.0439,0.111,-0.158,0.0894,-0.0039,0.0173,0.0768,0.1065,-0.1198,-0.0162,-0.024,-0.088,0.0151,-0.0156,-0.0717,-0.0018,0.0548,-0.0655,-0.0708,-0.0655,-0.0418,-0.1012,0.0722,-0.0782,-0.076,0.1656,0.1196,0.0214,-0.0544,-0.0332,-0.0534,0.1303,-0.0444,-0.0337,0.0324,0.0061,0.0782,-0.0867,-0.0607,-0.1065,-0.1625,-0.1496,0.0106,-0.0612,-0.0703,0.0196,0.038,-0.078,-0.0652,0.1193,0.0797,-0.0837,-0.0031,-0.0073,-0.0211,-0.085,-0.0442,-0.0533,0.0301,-0.1038,0.0638,0.0242,0.0223,-0.1014,0.0117,-0.0426,0.0364,-0.065,-0.0181,-0.0033,0.0662,0.2222,-0.0413,0.1895,0.0325,0.0067,-0.0714,0.0763,-0.0491,0.1752,-0.0845,0,-0.0493,0.0576,-0.106,0.0692,0.0067,0.1435,-0.0734,-0.0032,0.0535,-0.0283,0.1536,0.1055,-0.0922,-0.0281,0.0308,0.1032,-0.0702,0.1165,-0.0922,0.0551,0.1079,0.0632,-0.1381,-0.0223,-0.0312,0.0038,-0.0861,0.1805,0.0478,-0.0216,0.1077,-0.0576,-0.0248,0.0245,0.0206,0.0391,0.0101,0.0473,0.0576,0.174,-0.0988,-0.0656,-0.1042,-0.0059,-0.0138,0.0735,-0.1311,-0.052,-0.0517,-0.0763,-0.0673,-0.0009,-0.0497,0.0354,0.1471,0.1056,0.1071,0.135,0.061,0.0674,0.0573,0.0622,-0.0279,0.1313],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdTooltipSystem.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

Omit tooltips for elements where the function is fully self-explanatory.\n  - Stats on cards must provide tooltip descriptions using accessible markdown.\n  - Country flag icons require tooltips explaining nationality abbreviations.\n  - Weight indicators must include tooltip text clarifying weight classes.\n  - Navigation links in the battle screen should expose tooltip guidance.\n  - Help icons anywhere in the UI must render tooltip content from `tooltips.json`.\n- **Clarity**: Text should be immediately understandable, avoiding jargon. Game-specific terms must be explained using plain language. Aim for a reading level accessible to 10–12-year-olds.\n- **Concisiveness**: Tooltips should be succinct – ideally one sentence, or two short ones. Avoid paragraphs or rambling explanations.\n- **Tone & Voice**: Tooltips must reflect JU-DO-KON!’s style: casual, instructional, and game-themed. Prefer friendly second-person phrasing (\"Tap to...\") or descriptive third-person as appropriate.\n- **Formatting & Consistency**: Use consistent style:\n  - Bold (`**bold**`) key terms or stat names.\n  - Italicize (`_italic_`) non-English terms or soft emphasis.\n  - Use in-game terminology (e.g. \"judoka\", not \"character\").\n  - Maintain uniform punctuation and capitalization.\n- **U","qaContext":"unless needed.","embedding":[-0.1483,0.02,-0.0153,-0.0241,0.0472,0.0278,0.1405,0.0259,-0.0803,-0.0327,0.0536,-0.1245,0.0307,0.0008,0.0552,0.0292,0.1274,-0.0235,-0.0536,0.0136,0.1555,-0.056,0.1109,0.044,-0.049,0.0174,-0.0946,0.0758,-0.1631,0.0047,-0.0869,0.1027,-0.0223,-0.005,-0.0482,-0.0136,0.084,0.0929,-0.0547,0.0137,-0.1816,-0.0465,-0.0339,-0.0053,0.0936,-0.1427,-0.0905,-0.1065,-0.0011,0.2222,-0.0931,-0.1191,0.0145,-0.0072,0.0939,0.0146,-0.0358,-0.0535,0.0666,-0.0135,-0.0845,0.0201,-0.0121,0.1146,0.0431,-0.0748,-0.0295,0.0205,-0.0164,0.0635,-0.0456,0.0094,0.0461,0.0918,-0.0806,0.0549,-0.058,0.0006,-0.0081,-0.1591,-0.0655,0.1021,0.0137,0.0641,-0.0011,-0.0178,0.0475,-0.0073,-0.0425,0.059,0.022,-0.0238,0.1612,0.0102,0.0676,0.0221,-0.0079,-0.205,-0.1728,0.0786,0.0242,-0.0307,0.0553,-0.1007,-0.0057,0.0553,-0.0522,-0.0604,-0.1029,0.011,0.0079,0.007,-0.1654,-0.1037,0.1021,-0.0066,0.0364,-0.0832,0.1586,0.0616,0.1092,0.05,-0.0757,-0.047,0.1361,0.0467,-0.0206,0,0.1582,0.027,-0.1274,0.1506,-0.0412,-0.0387,-0.0542,-0.0365,-0.196,-0.0054,0.034,0.1421,-0.1179,0.0192,0.1158,0.0713,-0.0211,0.0265,-0.0362,0.0229,0.0265,-0.1091,0.0087,0.0206,0.1078,0.0654,-0.038,-0.0578,0.0023,0.034,-0.0547,-0.1397,0.0374,-0.1144,-0.0642,-0.0584,-0.0422,-0.1208,0.0066,-0.0116,-0.0459,-0.0927,-0.0487,-0.0032,0.073,0.0779,0.027,0.0104,0.1145,0.0996,-0.0991,-0.0417,0.1229,-0.0444,0.0521,0.0524,0.0412,-0.0124,-0.0107,-0.0351,-0.0113,0.0519,-0.0203,-0.0457,-0.0144,0.0362,-0.0711,0.1007,0.1114,-0.1947,-0.1251,0.0043,0.1154,0.1456,-0.0285,-0.1098,0.0136,-0.1159,0.0416,-0.0073,0.0066,-0.0263,-0.0346,-0.0405,-0.0628,-0.1218,0.1173,-0.1427,-0.1461,0.0003,-0.0426,0.0128,-0.1257,-0.0261,-0.1642,0,-0.0072,-0.0436,-0.1076,0.1626,-0.0306,0.0534,0.0071,0.0032,0.1257,-0.1584,-0.0739,0.1337,-0.0543,-0.1271,0.0818,0.0391,-0.1863,0.0283,0.0143,0.0309,0.0768,0.0367,-0.154,0.0117,-0.012,-0.049,0.0127,-0.0966,-0.0235,-0.0344,0.0451,0.0222,-0.0189,-0.0244,0.0065,-0.0938,0.119,-0.1395,-0.0766,0.1867,0.1859,0.0188,-0.0004,-0.1564,-0.0761,0.0637,-0.0698,-0.0283,-0.0348,0.0763,-0.0056,-0.1577,-0.0636,-0.0405,-0.1263,-0.1049,-0.0072,-0.0432,-0.0495,0.0232,-0.0136,-0.0423,-0.0462,0.146,0.0637,-0.1226,-0.0664,0.0461,-0.0447,-0.0455,-0.0644,-0.0461,0.0919,-0.132,0.0043,0.0109,0.0635,-0.0536,-0.0058,-0.1007,0.0199,0.0282,0.0086,0.0394,0.0184,0.1954,-0.0376,0.1157,-0.0085,-0.0011,-0.0288,0.0576,0.0654,0.101,-0.0514,0,-0.0242,0.1138,-0.0086,0.0731,-0.0365,0.073,0.0191,-0.0827,0.0481,0.0581,0.1434,0.1042,-0.123,-0.0376,-0.0018,0.0343,-0.0586,0.1411,-0.0888,0.0041,0.1018,0.076,-0.0928,0.0229,-0.0542,0.0032,-0.0475,0.0925,0.0478,0.0661,0.0625,0.0011,-0.0743,-0.0859,-0.0231,0.0829,-0.0047,0.049,0.1169,0.267,-0.0533,-0.0354,-0.1158,-0.0862,0.074,0.0811,-0.0692,-0.0466,-0.046,-0.0842,-0.0892,0.0157,-0.0798,0.0121,0.1341,0.1121,0.0964,0.106,0.0663,0.0283,0.0815,0.0525,-0.0164,0.1238],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdTooltipSystem.md [chunk 4]","tags":["prd","design-doc","what"],"version":1},

Ensure each tooltip serves a distinct explanatory purpose.\n- **Review Process**: All new tooltips must pass a readability and tone check, including spelling, grammar, and natural phrasing when read aloud.\n\n---\n\n## Dependencies and Open Questions\n\n### Dependencies:\n\n- Access to `tooltips.json` file within `/data/` or similar directory.\n- Basic utility functions for positioning and parsing markdown-like syntax.\n\n### Open Questions:\n\n- Should we support richer content in tooltips (e.g. icons, links)?\n- Do we want to internationalize `tooltips.json` immediately or defer localization support?\n- Should tooltip delays or animations be configurable in settings?\n- Should touch-triggered tooltips behave the same on tablets as on phones?\n\n---\n\n## See also:\n\n- PRD: Browse Judoka (for card stat structure)\n- PRD: Classic Battle (for stat selection flow where tooltips will appear)\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] 1.0 Setup Tooltip Content Source\n\n  - [x] 1.1 Create `tooltips.json` in `/data/` with at least 10 entries\n  - [x] 1.2 Define unique keys like `stat.power`, `stat.kumikata`, `stat.newaza`\n  - [x] 1.3 Plan for optional localization structure (future-proof keys)\n  - [x] 1.4 Review initial tooltips against the quality rubric before rollout.\n\n- [x] 2.0 Implement Tooltip Trigger Logic\n\n  - [x] 2.1 Detect elements with `data-tooltip-id`\n  - [x] 2.2 Fetch corresponding tooltip text from `tooltips.json`\n  - [x] 2.3 Handle missing or invali","qaContext":"inology (e.","embedding":[-0.1696,0.041,-0.0517,0.0219,0.0433,-0.0175,0.1368,0.0191,-0.0092,-0.0339,0.0636,-0.0592,0.0846,0.0042,0.0332,0.0412,0.0345,-0.0008,-0.0664,-0.0395,0.1219,0.0101,0.0946,0.0319,-0.0233,0.0604,-0.052,0.0357,-0.1331,-0.0249,-0.0838,0.0951,0.0061,0.0072,0.023,0.0301,0.06,0.0554,0.0109,0.0085,-0.1503,-0.0038,-0.029,-0.0041,0.0904,-0.1054,-0.0785,-0.088,-0.0078,0.1825,-0.1587,-0.046,0.0116,-0.0037,0.128,0.0252,-0.0155,-0.0592,0.0334,0.0163,0.0008,0.0323,-0.0239,0.0715,0.0195,-0.0572,0.0061,0.0107,-0.0113,0.0444,-0.0899,0.0138,0.0043,0.0657,-0.079,0.1242,-0.0439,-0.0021,-0.0615,-0.2097,-0.0369,0.0571,0.0944,0.0774,-0.016,0.0028,0.1364,-0.0084,0.0499,0.075,0.0179,-0.1011,0.0556,-0.0011,0.0487,0.0287,-0.033,-0.125,-0.0807,0.0837,-0.0032,-0.076,0.0576,-0.0617,0.0027,0.0687,-0.0482,-0.0911,-0.0573,-0.0225,0.0248,0.0207,-0.1286,-0.0297,0.0184,-0.007,0.0882,-0.0694,0.0962,0.0455,0.1023,0.0055,-0.1051,-0.0275,0.1166,0.0679,-0.0377,0,0.0768,-0.0617,-0.0706,0.0217,-0.0921,-0.035,-0.0649,-0.0567,-0.1583,0.0068,0.0485,0.1306,-0.1269,-0.009,0.086,-0.042,0.0448,0.0478,-0.0438,0.007,0.0339,-0.0409,-0.0453,-0.0213,0.0856,0.153,0.0137,-0.0934,-0.0485,0.0307,-0.0764,-0.1098,0.0014,-0.0646,-0.0413,-0.0188,-0.0396,-0.0863,0.0017,-0.0098,-0.0056,-0.0347,-0.0492,-0.0448,0.0153,0.0655,-0.0472,0.032,0.114,0.0012,-0.0734,0.0522,0.1214,0.0101,0.0374,0.0119,0.0064,-0.0137,0.0742,0.0234,-0.0758,0.0527,-0.0716,-0.0146,0.0192,0.0502,-0.0538,0.0451,0.0773,-0.0502,-0.1427,0.0204,0.0461,0.1398,0.0187,-0.1421,-0.0423,-0.0701,0.001,-0.0664,-0.0608,-0.0305,-0.0428,-0.0242,0.0415,-0.0288,0.1381,-0.1206,-0.1868,-0.0543,-0.017,0.0485,-0.0873,-0.0539,-0.1197,0,0.0221,-0.0557,-0.031,0.1909,-0.081,-0.0406,-0.0167,0.0233,0.0823,-0.1274,-0.0217,0.0282,-0.0559,-0.0792,0.0618,0.0942,-0.1305,0.0113,-0.0304,0.0349,0.0459,0.0637,-0.0591,0.0336,-0.0511,-0.038,0.0288,-0.0582,-0.0497,-0.0484,-0.0744,0.0278,-0.0831,-0.0198,-0.0016,-0.141,0.0675,-0.1255,-0.0133,0.2141,0.1746,0.0327,-0.0783,-0.0341,-0.0458,0.0519,-0.0932,0.0779,-0.0374,-0.0424,0.0356,-0.0977,-0.0466,-0.0532,-0.1186,-0.0785,0.0344,-0.0919,-0.047,0.0408,-0.0581,-0.0272,0.0294,0.06,0.1041,-0.0855,-0.0081,-0.0286,-0.0233,-0.063,-0.0071,-0.062,0.0461,-0.0736,0.0492,0.0473,0.034,-0.0719,0.0647,-0.046,0.0387,0.018,0.0492,0.0677,0.0016,0.1711,-0.071,0.1429,0.0296,0.0214,-0.0367,0.0368,0.1071,0.092,-0.088,0,-0.0806,0.0209,-0.04,0.0786,-0.0284,0.0956,-0.0388,0.0259,0.0515,-0.0461,0.1336,0.1708,-0.1362,-0.0166,-0.0558,0.0627,0.0006,0.153,-0.0978,0.0061,0.0228,0.0456,-0.0485,0.013,-0.0705,-0.0221,-0.081,0.0526,0.0524,0.0311,0.0972,-0.0394,-0.054,0.0068,-0.0094,0.0475,0.0385,0.0663,0.0873,0.1627,-0.0364,-0.0588,-0.1747,-0.087,-0.009,-0.0011,-0.0667,-0.0692,-0.1,-0.1355,-0.0651,-0.0135,-0.015,-0.0228,0.0719,0.093,0.0995,0.0311,0.0385,-0.0091,0.0307,-0.0188,0.0436,0.1063],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdTooltipSystem.md [chunk 5]","tags":["prd","design-doc","how"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdTooltipSystem.md-chunk-12","text":"## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] The system loads `tooltips.json` once at app start. Entries are grouped by category (for example `stat.power` or `ui.selectStat`). (**P1: tooltips.json store**)\n- [ ] Hovering an element with `data-tooltip-id=\"stat.kumikata\"` displays a tooltip with the parsed value from `tooltips.json`. (**P1: data-tooltip-id hook**)\n- [ ] Tooltip supports: `**bold**` as `<strong>`, `_italic_` as `<em>`, and `\\n` as line breaks. (**P1: Markdown-like formatting**)\n- [ ] Tooltip content adheres to the style and quality standards defined in the \"Tooltip Content Guidelines\" section, including clarity, tone, and usefulness.\n- [ ] Tooltip appears within **150ms** of hover and is positioned relative to the element (bottom-left preferred). (**P1: Positioning logic**)\n- [ ] Tooltip disappears when the mouse leaves the element or when focus is lost. (**P2: Auto-hide on mouseout**)\n- [ ] If an invalid `data-tooltip-id` is provided (no matching key), no tooltip appears and no console error is thrown. (**P1: data-tooltip-id hook**)\n- [ ] Styling matches visual guidelines: white background, dark text, soft shadow, rounded corners. (**P2: Tooltip styling**)\n- [ ] If `tooltips.json` fails to load at runtime, tooltips are suppressed and an error is logged once.

Game-specific terms must be explained using plain language. Aim for a reading level accessible to 10–12-year-olds.\n- **Concisiveness**: Tooltips should be succinct – ideally one sentence, or two short ones.

{"id":"prdTooltipSystem.md-chunk-15","text":"### Tooltip Content Guidelines\n\nTo ensure tooltips are consistently helpful and aligned with JU-DO-KON!’s tone, the following content standards must be followed when writing or reviewing tooltips:\n\n- **Coverage**: Every interactive UI element that could confuse a new or young player should have a tooltip. Omit tooltips for elements where the function is fully self-explanatory.\n  - Stats on cards must provide tooltip descriptions using accessible markdown.\n  - Country flag icons require tooltips explaining nationality abbreviations.\n  - Weight indicators must include tooltip text clarifying weight classes.\n  - Navigation links in the battle screen should expose tooltip guidance.\n  - Help icons anywhere in the UI must render tooltip content from `tooltips.json`.\n- **Clarity**: Text should be immediately understandable, avoiding jargon. Game-specific terms must be explained using plain language. Aim for a reading level accessible to 10–12-year-olds.\n- **Concisiveness**: Tooltips should be succinct – ideally one sentence, or two short ones. Avoid paragraphs or rambling explanations.\n- **Tone & Voice**: Tooltips must reflect JU-DO-KON!’s style: casual, instructional, and game-themed. Prefer friendly second-person phrasing (\"Tap to...\") or descriptive third-person as appropriate.\n- **Formatting & Consistency**: Use consistent style:\n  - Bold (`**bold**`) key terms or stat names.\n  - Italicize (`_italic_`) non-English terms or soft emphasis.\n  - Use in-game terminology (e.g. \"judoka\", not \"character\").\n  - Maintain uniform punctuation and capitalization.\n- **Usefulness**: Each tooltip should add context or new information. Do not merely restate the label.\n- **Accuracy**: Text must reflect the latest game rules and UI behavior. Outdated or misleading tooltips must be removed or revised.\n- **Accessibility**: Tooltips should make sense when read aloud by a screen reader.

{"id":"prdTeamBattleRules.md-chunk-1","text":"# PRD: Team Battle Rules\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nBase rule set for Team Battle modes. Teams fight in a series of 1v1 bouts with points awarded per bout. The first team to reach the team-size score wins.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nPlayers enjoy forming teams of favorite judoka, but rules vary between modes and lack a single source of truth. Inconsistent scoring and win conditions confuse newcomers and shorten play sessions. This document defines core rules so every Team Battle behaves predictably.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n- Provide one authoritative rule set for all Team Battle modes.\n- Keep average match duration under **10 minutes**.\n- Ensure scoring is calculated consistently across modes.\n\n---\n\n## User Stories\n\n- As a player, I want my team to fight one judoka at a time so I can plan the order strategically.\n- As a competitor, I want a clear win condition so I know when the match is over.\n- As a developer, I want shared logic that other Team Battle PRDs can inherit.\n\n---\n\n## Overview of Match Flow\n\n- Each team arranges its judoka in a fixed order before the match starts.\n- Fighters face off one at a time in sequential 1v1 bouts.\n- A bout uses the same comparison logic as Classic Battle: each side draws a card using `generateRandomCard()` and compares the chosen stat.\n- The winning side earns **one point**. The next judoka in each lineup then competes.\n- The process repeats until one team earns points equal to the number of judoka on its roster.\n\n---\n\n## Scoring and Win Conditions\n\n- Default team size is five members (Male and Female modes) or six members (Mixed mode).\n- Teams score one point per victorious bout.\n- The first team to score the full team-size total wins the match.\n- If a bout ends in a tie, no point is awarded and the next fighters compete.\n\n---\n\n## Prioritized Functional Requirements\n\n| Priority | Feature              | Description                                               |\n| -------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------","qaContext":"PRD: Team Battle Rules --- ## TL;DR Base rule set for Team Battle modes.","embedding":[-0.0604,0.1444,-0.0119,-0.0001,0.0277,0.1292,0.0896,0.0615,0.0914,0.0802,-0.0665,-0.1648,0.178,0.1015,0.0311,0.0118,-0.0415,0.0126,-0.0953,0.0259,0.0732,-0.2073,0.0005,-0.063,0.0447,-0.0352,-0.0252,0.0387,-0.0674,-0.0719,-0.0219,0.1017,0.1024,0.032,-0.0481,-0.0823,-0.1315,-0.0116,-0.0383,0.0089,-0.1381,-0.0626,0.0756,0.0212,0.1012,0.1671,-0.0944,0.1136,-0.0944,-0.0897,-0.1078,0.0509,-0.0033,0.0338,0.2262,-0.0562,0.0042,-0.1252,-0.051,-0.0995,-0.0163,-0.072,-0.1283,-0.0234,-0.0691,-0.0891,0.0558,0.1742,-0.0103,0.1206,0.0059,0.0636,-0.0019,0.0225,0.0519,0.1672,-0.0229,-0.0754,0.0134,-0.0385,-0.1413,-0.0223,-0.0402,0.0007,0.1077,-0.2053,0.1509,-0.0165,0.1866,0.0678,-0.0745,0.2154,0.0739,-0.0054,0.1394,0.0937,-0.0211,0.0165,0.0592,0.1546,-0.0506,0.0086,-0.049,-0.0807,0.1514,0.0808,-0.0568,0.0481,0.0199,-0.1152,0.0018,0.0123,-0.0185,0.0767,-0.0399,0.0777,0.0433,0.1019,0.0244,0.0089,0.1093,-0.0463,0.0306,0.014,0.073,0.0378,0.0171,0,-0.0051,-0.2211,-0.0852,0.0243,-0.0776,0.0479,-0.0325,-0.1017,-0.1727,-0.0236,-0.1873,0.0872,-0.0727,-0.0005,0.1325,-0.058,-0.0671,0.0097,-0.1086,0.0312,0.1404,0.0081,-0.0593,-0.0978,-0.0003,0.0174,-0.0623,-0.1206,-0.1037,-0.017,-0.0194,-0.1368,-0.0607,0.0337,-0.0924,0.0001,0.1173,0.0163,0.047,0.0524,-0.1876,-0.0752,-0.0759,-0.0736,-0.0701,-0.1156,-0.2091,0.0845,-0.0363,0.1617,-0.0156,0.0323,0.1649,-0.0959,-0.033,0.052,0.0457,0.0976,-0.0919,0.1598,-0.0309,-0.0405,-0.093,0.0062,0.0104,0.084,-0.1246,-0.0802,0.1641,-0.1564,-0.0851,0.0351,0.0347,-0.089,0.0452,-0.1581,0.1067,0.1577,-0.0927,-0.0898,-0.043,0.1118,-0.0814,-0.0569,-0.0298,0.0555,0.0122,-0.0949,-0.2668,-0.0227,-0.0373,-0.0674,0.1004,0.1417,0.0825,0,0.004,-0.0353,0.0525,0.0555,0.2302,-0.0115,0.0017,-0.1154,0.0102,-0.0806,0.0039,-0.031,-0.0814,-0.0398,-0.0158,-0.0608,0.0345,-0.0385,-0.0475,0.1254,0.1188,0.1365,-0.1344,-0.0549,0.0426,-0.0052,0.006,-0.0263,0.0319,0.0423,0.0251,-0.172,-0.1225,0.0148,0.0548,-0.123,-0.0007,0.0104,0.0473,0.2467,0.0739,-0.0717,-0.1184,0.0466,0.0765,0.1066,0.0751,-0.0289,-0.0135,-0.108,0.0526,-0.0495,-0.1125,-0.0311,-0.1619,-0.0572,-0.0053,-0.0732,-0.0564,0.1197,0.0544,-0.012,0.0121,0.1473,-0.0126,0.0717,-0.082,-0.0026,-0.0008,0.0762,-0.1049,0.0839,-0.034,-0.0547,0.1651,0.1327,-0.1881,0.0922,0.1355,0.0793,-0.2264,0.0673,0.0299,-0.0224,-0.0474,0.1317,0.0764,0.1159,0.0651,0.0341,0.0162,0.0185,0.206,-0.0882,-0.0503,0,-0.111,-0.1184,-0.1074,0.1118,0.0283,0.1097,-0.0572,-0.2277,-0.0497,0.041,0.2036,0.0862,-0.0778,-0.1157,-0.0733,-0.0346,-0.0504,0.0122,-0.1353,-0.0282,-0.0412,-0.0871,-0.1647,-0.0106,-0.0845,0.0415,-0.0809,0.0213,0.0067,0.048,0.0963,0.0071,-0.0769,0.0896,0.0762,0.0549,0.0107,0.061,0.0276,0.0754,-0.0385,-0.0659,-0.013,-0.0411,0.1197,0.0019,-0.0495,-0.1813,-0.0328,-0.1318,0.1148,-0.1101,-0.0956,-0.0737,0.0707,0.104,0.0657,-0.018,0.1183,-0.0072,-0.0443,0.0154,-0.0479,0.0534],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdTeamBattleRules.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

This PRD formalizes a mixed format that uses the base Team Battle rules.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n- Support six‑member teams with no gender restrictions.\n- Mirror the pacing and scoring of other Team Battle variants.\n\n---\n\n## User Stories\n\n- As a player, I want to mix genders on my team so I can use my favorite judoka regardless of gender.\n- As a developer, I want this mode to reuse the base Team Battle logic for consistency.\n\n---\n\n## Prioritized Functional Requirements\n\n| Priority | Feature               | Description                                                          |\n| :------: | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|  **P1**  | Mixed Roster Allowed  | Teams may include any combination of male and female judoka.         |\n|  **P1**  | Fixed Team Size       | Each team contains exactly 6 judoka.                                 |\n|  **P1**  | Base Rule Inheritance | Follow all rules in [PRD: Team Battle Rules](prdTeamBattleRules.md). |\n|  **P2**  | Early Quit Allowed    | Player may forfeit the match early.                                  |\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Teams can contain any mix of male and female judoka.\n- A match ends when one team scores 6 points.\n- All other behavior matches the base Team Battle Rules.\n- Quitting early records a loss for the quitting player.\n\n---\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n- Match flow updates with **≤200 ms** latency.\n- Maintain **≥60 fps** during battle animations.\n\n---\n\n## Mode-Specific Details\n\n- Allowed genders: **any**\n- Team size: **6 judoka per team**\n\n---\n\n## Rela","qaContext":"PRD: Team Battle (Mixed) --- ## TL;DR This mode inherits the base rules from [PRD: Team Battle Rules](prdTeamBattleRules.","embedding":[-0.0097,0.1091,0.0019,-0.0437,-0.0071,0.1294,0.071,0.0083,-0.0178,0.0244,-0.0427,-0.1523,0.1084,0.0952,0.1508,0.0505,-0.0318,0.1221,-0.1439,0.0324,0.1054,-0.1563,-0.0246,-0.0455,-0.101,-0.0409,0.0134,0.0752,-0.1276,-0.1128,-0.0434,0.1905,0.0602,-0.0263,0.0732,-0.0072,-0.1239,0.0467,0,0.0073,-0.1383,-0.0483,0.029,0.0356,0.0134,0.1085,-0.1341,0.0804,-0.0976,-0.0652,-0.054,-0.0756,-0.0424,0.1234,0.2683,-0.0277,0.0191,-0.0932,-0.0471,-0.069,-0.0441,-0.0238,-0.1328,-0.0435,-0.0348,-0.076,-0.0268,0.1138,0.0336,0.0962,0.0405,0.1025,-0.0757,0.0406,0.0024,0.215,0.0298,-0.0415,0.0539,-0.1275,-0.1585,-0.0519,-0.0343,0.0002,0.1068,-0.1996,0.0864,-0.1037,0.0808,0.0987,-0.0521,0.188,0.2735,-0.0816,0.0859,0.1248,-0.0482,-0.0768,0.0469,0.1467,-0.0546,-0.0237,-0.0246,-0.0026,-0.0071,-0.0117,-0.0163,0.0617,-0.0281,-0.0592,-0.0051,0.066,-0.1088,-0.0467,-0.0144,0.0397,0.106,0.0803,-0.0097,-0.0526,0.069,-0.0235,0.0955,0.0617,0.1888,0.0733,0.0174,0,0.0092,-0.2203,-0.1188,0.081,0.0289,0.047,0.0194,-0.1043,-0.1722,-0.0796,-0.1187,0.0455,-0.1398,-0.0363,0.1047,-0.1031,-0.0371,0.1416,-0.0928,0.0815,0.1051,0.0482,-0.1174,-0.0716,0.0146,0.0678,-0.0027,-0.0476,-0.1132,0.0022,-0.0223,-0.135,-0.0339,0.0387,-0.0818,0.0116,-0.01,-0.011,0.0137,0.0915,-0.1218,-0.1238,-0.1029,-0.0635,0.0085,-0.1147,-0.1293,0.0505,-0.0008,0.0432,0.0043,0.0798,0.1271,-0.1613,-0.0129,-0.0549,-0.0034,0.1015,0.0084,0.1382,0.0626,0.0341,-0.0691,0.1036,0.0595,0.0615,-0.074,-0.1098,0.1896,-0.2035,-0.1529,0.0039,0.1202,0.0457,-0.0423,-0.1034,0.0497,0.1765,-0.0598,-0.1127,-0.0431,0.1297,-0.1411,0.0594,-0.0828,-0.0354,0.0267,-0.0418,-0.303,0.029,-0.0186,-0.0883,0.0068,0.0777,0.1663,0,-0.0111,-0.0321,0.1024,-0.0763,0.2506,-0.0304,0.0796,-0.1039,0.0649,-0.0627,0.0105,-0.0885,-0.1639,-0.1487,-0.1276,-0.002,-0.1299,-0.0803,-0.0181,0.1949,0.0858,0.1671,-0.1313,0.13,0.0108,0.0175,-0.0447,-0.0035,0.0542,0.0875,0.0197,-0.1893,-0.1154,-0.0163,0.0066,-0.2439,-0.135,0.0598,0.0562,0.2766,0.1186,-0.0073,-0.2291,0.0373,0.0688,0.0747,0.1502,-0.0981,-0.0435,-0.0638,-0.0228,-0.0521,-0.1502,-0.0746,-0.0921,-0.1197,0.0348,-0.1465,-0.0446,0.0973,0.0665,0.0481,0.0207,0.1081,0.013,-0.0233,-0.0854,-0.0461,-0.1208,0.0289,-0.1113,-0.0371,0.0251,0.0004,0.1624,0.0351,-0.137,0.0682,0.152,0.1281,-0.2354,0.0328,0.0136,0.061,-0.0325,0.1731,-0.0119,0.1548,0.1266,0.0406,-0.0206,-0.0019,0.1782,-0.0404,-0.0332,0,-0.0669,-0.0565,-0.0612,0.0734,-0.0302,-0.0204,-0.077,-0.1968,0.0166,0.0656,0.1121,0.1362,-0.0765,-0.1159,-0.0302,-0.0513,-0.057,0.0491,-0.1722,-0.0345,0.0114,-0.1063,-0.1886,-0.0087,0.0071,-0.0037,-0.064,0.033,-0.0699,0.053,0.1548,-0.006,-0.1303,0.1224,0.0411,0.0955,0.0803,0.03,-0.022,0.0395,0.0176,-0.1478,-0.1101,0.0058,0.1345,-0.0039,-0.13,-0.2397,-0.0683,-0.0552,-0.0015,-0.0906,-0.0541,-0.0259,0.0715,0.1519,0.0654,0.01,0.0514,-0.0498,0.0613,0.0102,0.0487,0.0157],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdTeamBattleMixed.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

This PRD defines the male-only variant built on the shared Team Battle rules.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n- Offer a straightforward 5‑vs‑5 male format.\n- Use the same scoring and pacing as the other Team Battle modes.\n\n---\n\n## User Stories\n\n- As a player, I want to select only male judoka for my team so the match feels authentic.\n- As a developer, I want this mode to leverage the base Team Battle logic.\n\n---\n\n## Prioritized Functional Requirements\n\n| Priority | Feature               | Description                                                          |\n| :------: | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|  **P1**  | Male Roster Only      | Restrict team selection to judoka marked as male.                    |\n|  **P1**  | Fixed Team Size       | Each team contains exactly 5 judoka.                                 |\n|  **P1**  | Base Rule Inheritance | Follow all rules in [PRD: Team Battle Rules](prdTeamBattleRules.md). |\n|  **P2**  | Early Quit Allowed    | Player may forfeit the match early.                                  |\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Only male judoka can be chosen when forming a team.\n- A match ends when one team scores 5 points.\n- All other behavior matches the base Team Battle Rules.\n- Quitting early records a loss for the quitting player.\n\n---\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n- Match flow updates with **≤200 ms** latency.\n- Maintain **≥60 fps** during battle animations.\n\n---\n\n## Mode-Specific Details\n\n- Allowed gender: **male only**\n- Team size: **5 judoka per team**\n\n---\n\n## Related Features\n\n- [PRD: Tea","qaContext":"PRD: Team Battle (Male) --- ## TL;DR This mode inherits the base rules from [PRD: Team Battle Rules](prdTeamBattleRules.","embedding":[-0.0186,0.1575,-0.0226,-0.0345,0.064,0.0879,0.1002,0.0365,0.0053,0.0561,-0.0666,-0.1983,0.0793,0.1201,0.1332,0.071,-0.0338,0.0716,-0.0892,-0.0531,0.1528,-0.1136,-0.0471,-0.0966,-0.1049,-0.0539,0.0124,0.0671,-0.1197,-0.1243,-0.0111,0.1067,0.0977,-0.0091,-0.0032,-0.0759,-0.1582,-0.0395,-0.0155,-0.0536,-0.1152,-0.0646,0.0045,0.054,0.0136,0.1028,-0.161,0.0521,-0.033,-0.0191,-0.1202,-0.0585,-0.0168,0.0611,0.2407,-0.0246,-0.019,-0.1355,-0.0338,-0.1234,-0.0522,-0.0972,-0.1349,-0.0519,-0.0572,-0.0505,-0.031,0.0615,0.0422,0.1003,0.015,0.0923,-0.0848,0.0343,0.0204,0.1809,-0.0278,-0.0308,0.0351,-0.1466,-0.1514,-0.0571,-0.0862,0.042,0.0879,-0.1395,0.0772,-0.0917,0.1449,0.0898,-0.0508,0.142,0.1689,-0.0199,0.0134,0.1419,-0.0665,-0.0631,-0.0146,0.165,-0.0533,-0.0536,-0.0474,0.0033,-0.0085,-0.0145,0.0343,0.0628,-0.0393,-0.0543,-0.0512,0.116,-0.0734,-0.0834,-0.0295,0.1125,0.1126,0.0864,-0.0134,-0.0045,0.0878,-0.0057,0.0038,0.0792,0.1345,0.062,-0.0299,0,0.0833,-0.232,-0.1196,0.0048,-0.0067,0.0723,0.0157,-0.1165,-0.1684,-0.0671,-0.1585,0.0051,-0.1003,-0.0695,0.0579,-0.1223,-0.001,0.1052,-0.0908,0.0564,0.0619,0.0247,-0.1524,-0.0617,0.0866,0.0792,-0.0743,-0.104,-0.0752,0.0317,-0.0327,-0.1121,-0.0873,0.0311,-0.0157,0.0385,-0.0063,0.0187,0.0392,0.0864,-0.151,-0.1071,-0.1414,-0.0603,-0.0308,-0.1448,-0.1835,0.0822,-0.0259,0.0148,0.046,0.0586,0.0838,-0.1835,-0.0467,-0.0928,0.0045,0.1682,-0.0187,0.1461,0.0577,0.0089,-0.0479,0.09,0.0361,0.0398,-0.0929,-0.1296,0.1869,-0.185,-0.1082,0.0258,0.1476,-0.0009,-0.0036,-0.1105,0.0866,0.1851,-0.0297,-0.0622,-0.1141,0.1096,-0.1549,0.0192,-0.0306,-0.0298,0.0417,-0.073,-0.2612,-0.0256,-0.0624,-0.0635,-0.0417,0.049,0.1294,0,0.0084,-0.0146,0.1331,-0.0635,0.2018,-0.0427,0.1073,-0.1095,0.0588,-0.0034,0.0611,-0.0653,-0.1281,-0.1557,-0.044,0.0417,-0.116,-0.0711,-0.0352,0.1917,0.0626,0.2318,-0.1253,0.1271,-0.0325,-0.0013,-0.0094,0.0197,0.0334,0.0025,-0.0029,-0.1046,-0.1371,0.0161,-0.0052,-0.1836,-0.1051,0.1474,0.059,0.3067,0.1087,-0.0011,-0.1868,0.061,0.0243,0.0571,0.1851,-0.079,-0.0312,-0.0405,-0.011,-0.0112,-0.1084,-0.0306,-0.1025,-0.1319,0.0205,-0.1148,-0.0471,0.104,0.0915,0.0639,0.0534,0.1183,0.0583,-0.0091,-0.0532,0.03,-0.0886,0.0082,-0.1063,-0.0493,0.1,0.0031,0.1331,0.0257,-0.1556,0.1003,0.1183,0.1409,-0.2085,0.0694,0.0196,0.0368,-0.0639,0.1763,-0.0237,0.1287,0.1327,0.0063,-0.0025,-0.0002,0.144,-0.0155,-0.0364,0,-0.1179,-0.0943,-0.0896,0.077,0.0408,0.0651,-0.0986,-0.1257,0.0067,0.0164,0.1164,0.1286,-0.0751,-0.1076,0.0354,-0.0562,0.0029,0.0557,-0.1401,-0.0134,-0.033,-0.1032,-0.2142,-0.0016,0.0216,-0.0076,-0.0664,-0.0552,-0.0038,0.0975,0.1452,0.0185,-0.114,0.055,0.0872,0.1095,0.058,0.0347,-0.0463,0.0755,0.047,-0.0941,-0.0834,0.0202,0.1037,0.0209,-0.0783,-0.2045,-0.0008,-0.0676,0.0675,-0.107,-0.031,-0.0125,0.0268,0.1528,0.0752,0.0472,0.0497,-0.0887,0.1196,-0.0153,0.0331,0.0461],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdTeamBattleMale.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

Without it, female judoka receive less representation and players miss a strategic format focused entirely on women’s judo.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n- Showcase female judoka in a balanced 5‑vs‑5 format.\n- Keep match length and scoring consistent with other Team Battle modes.\n\n---\n\n## User Stories\n\n- As a player, I want to select a female-only team so I can compete using my favorite women judoka.\n- As a developer, I want this mode to reuse the Team Battle Rules logic so maintenance is minimal.\n\n---\n\n## Prioritized Functional Requirements\n\n| Priority | Feature               | Description                                                          |\n| :------: | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|  **P1**  | Female Roster Only    | Restrict team selection to judoka marked as female.                  |\n|  **P1**  | Fixed Team Size       | Each team contains exactly 5 judoka.                                 |\n|  **P1**  | Base Rule Inheritance | Follow all rules in [PRD: Team Battle Rules](prdTeamBattleRules.md). |\n|  **P2**  | Early Quit Allowed    | Player may forfeit the match early.                                  |\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Only female judoka can be chosen when forming a team.\n- A match ends when one team scores 5 points.\n- All other behavior matches the base Team Battle Rules.\n- Quitting early records a loss for the quitting player.\n\n---\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n- Match flow updates with **≤200 ms** latency.\n- Maintain **≥60 fps** during battle animations.\n\n---\n\n## Mode-Specific Details\n\n- Allowed gender: **female only**\n- T","qaContext":"PRD: Team Battle (Female) --- ## TL;DR This mode inherits the base rules from [PRD: Team Battle Rules](prdTeamBattleRules.","embedding":[-0.0033,0.1429,0.0236,-0.0068,0.0345,0.1319,0.0975,0.0729,0.019,0.0331,-0.0527,-0.1529,0.0899,0.1195,0.1231,0.1136,-0.0193,0.0992,-0.1585,-0.0507,0.1341,-0.1844,-0.05,-0.038,-0.1258,-0.0343,-0.0042,0.0844,-0.1532,-0.1158,-0.091,0.1624,0.0958,-0.0031,0.0364,0.0073,-0.1651,0.0187,0.0328,-0.0112,-0.1667,-0.1033,-0.0313,0.067,-0.0121,0.1253,-0.1612,0.0543,-0.0715,-0.076,-0.0703,-0.0306,-0.0613,0.0887,0.2733,-0.0336,-0.0083,-0.1258,-0.087,-0.1003,0.0353,-0.0469,-0.1199,-0.0531,-0.06,-0.0804,-0.0242,0.078,-0.0325,0.1458,0.0364,0.1042,-0.1141,0.0946,0.0386,0.209,0.0648,-0.0442,0.0334,-0.1343,-0.1805,-0.063,-0.0456,0.035,0.0832,-0.172,0.0534,-0.1308,0.1664,0.074,-0.0712,0.1662,0.2336,-0.0289,0.0407,0.1135,-0.0927,-0.0725,-0.0395,0.1553,-0.0832,-0.0471,0.003,0.0055,-0.0331,-0.0247,0.0384,0.0704,-0.0222,-0.0461,-0.0106,0.1282,-0.1351,-0.0342,-0.0407,0.1167,0.0976,0.1128,-0.0008,-0.0128,0.1153,-0.0121,0.0206,0.0521,0.1339,0.0521,-0.0218,0,0.0523,-0.2319,-0.1149,0.0362,0.0059,0.0617,0.0496,-0.1309,-0.1869,-0.0897,-0.1242,0.0231,-0.1357,-0.102,0.0986,-0.0731,-0.003,0.1318,-0.0931,0.0871,0.1016,0.0633,-0.1125,-0.082,0.0438,0.0725,-0.0072,-0.1107,-0.1411,0.0191,-0.0214,-0.1497,-0.0884,-0.0068,-0.015,0.0421,0.0108,0.0331,0.0288,0.0899,-0.1533,-0.1227,-0.0919,-0.0779,-0.0125,-0.1248,-0.105,0.0722,-0.0483,0.0496,0.0357,0.0419,0.0933,-0.152,-0.077,-0.0724,-0.0021,0.1222,-0.0174,0.1241,0.0408,0.0344,-0.0805,0.0853,0.062,0.0356,-0.0735,-0.125,0.1951,-0.1752,-0.1126,0.0311,0.18,0.0395,-0.0334,-0.0701,0.129,0.1684,-0.0245,-0.0608,-0.0451,0.115,-0.1405,0.0444,-0.0314,-0.0097,0.0614,-0.0761,-0.269,-0.0041,-0.022,-0.0542,-0.0607,0.0073,0.1261,0,0.0445,-0.0613,0.1551,-0.0568,0.1955,-0.0402,0.0799,-0.0651,0.0108,-0.0599,0.0918,-0.1018,-0.1895,-0.161,-0.0961,0.0566,-0.1682,-0.0934,-0.0714,0.1834,0.0638,0.2358,-0.111,0.12,-0.0303,0.0204,-0.0045,0.0368,0.0236,0.0169,0.0185,-0.154,-0.1242,-0.0014,-0.0002,-0.2064,-0.1578,0.104,0.0626,0.3394,0.1122,-0.0063,-0.1764,0.0553,0.0057,0.0612,0.1714,-0.0733,0.01,-0.0704,0.0099,-0.0859,-0.1467,-0.0199,-0.0859,-0.1294,0.0444,-0.1183,-0.0244,0.103,0.054,0.0947,0.0437,0.0878,0.0474,-0.0732,-0.0752,0.0036,-0.1493,-0.0298,-0.1292,-0.0098,0.0609,-0.0044,0.1147,0.0465,-0.1644,0.094,0.1539,0.1518,-0.2507,0.0084,-0.0344,0.0059,-0.0025,0.1564,-0.0276,0.1393,0.1592,0.0165,0.003,0.0056,0.2071,-0.0299,-0.0626,0,-0.1241,-0.044,-0.0455,0.0737,0.0266,-0.0026,-0.0593,-0.0908,0.036,0.0335,0.1074,0.1374,-0.0959,-0.0673,-0.0206,-0.0396,-0.0326,0.0817,-0.1437,-0.0068,-0.0321,-0.1922,-0.2098,-0.0021,0.0342,-0.0428,-0.0659,-0.0139,-0.0313,0.0635,0.1348,0.0309,-0.0599,0.0733,0.0595,0.1073,0.0797,-0.0042,-0.1226,0.0812,-0.0061,-0.1491,-0.0962,0.0337,0.1355,-0.0424,-0.0671,-0.2396,-0.0216,-0.1199,0.0795,-0.16,-0.0068,-0.0441,-0.0163,0.183,0.1244,0.0755,0.043,-0.0675,0.063,-0.0251,0.0562,0.0346],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdTeamBattleFemale.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdSettingsMenu.md-chunk-1","text":"# PRD: Settings Menu\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThis PRD defines the Settings Menu for Ju-Do-Kon!, enabling players to control sound, motion effects, navigation map, display mode, and the visibility of certain game modes. These options improve accessibility, personalization, and retention by empowering users to tailor the game to their needs.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nAs a user of the game _Ju-Do-Kon!_, I want to be able to change settings such as display mode, navigation map, motion effects, and sound, to tailor my experience and reduce frustration — especially for players sensitive to motion or needing visual adjustments. Playtesting shows **35% of users quit early when unable to adjust motion effects**, indicating the need for accessible, customizable gameplay.\n\n> Kazuki, a player who’s prone to motion sickness, launches Ju-Do-Kon! for the first time.

This approach supports accessibility, scalability, and a cleaner user experience as more settings are added.\n\n### Functional Requirement\n\n- Each settings area is collapsed by default and can be expanded/collapsed by the user.\n- Section headers are keyboard-focusable and operable (Enter/Space).\n- ARIA attributes (`aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-labelledby`) are used for accessibility.\n- Only expanded sections are included in the tab order.\n- The implementation must meet all accessibility and performance requirements outlined elsewhere in this PRD.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n- AC-9.1 All settings areas are collapsed by default on page load.\n- AC-9.2 Clicking or pressing Enter/Space on a section header toggles its expanded/collapsed state and updates `aria-expanded`.\n- AC-9.3 When collapsed, section content is hidden from both view and tab order.\n- AC-9.4 When expanded, section content is visible and all controls are accessible via keyboard and screen reader.\n- AC-9.5 Section toggles and content meet touch target and color contrast requirements.\n\n### Rationale\n\nTh","qaContext":"ve keyboard focus indicators.","embedding":[-0.0606,0.0187,-0.059,0.078,0.0612,0.1455,0.1115,0.1507,-0.0946,0.0282,0.0777,-0.0094,0.0817,-0.084,0.0391,-0.0392,0.0099,-0.0647,-0.169,-0.0351,0.1352,-0.1147,0.0164,-0.1396,-0.0778,0.1195,-0.1201,-0.0425,-0.0566,-0.0639,-0.0189,0.0865,0.0725,0.043,-0.0345,-0.0644,0.0076,-0.0567,-0.0846,-0.0489,-0.1942,0.0258,0.0165,0.1049,-0.0244,-0.0292,-0.0886,0.0039,-0.0918,0.0024,-0.0324,-0.0475,0.0705,0.0329,0.0003,0.0086,-0.0682,-0.0267,0.0037,0.0558,-0.0818,-0.015,-0.0013,0.038,0.0329,0.104,0.0238,-0.1279,-0.075,-0.0166,-0.0478,-0.0399,0.0943,-0.0199,0.0476,-0.0317,-0.075,-0.0591,-0.0625,-0.1342,-0.0333,0.098,-0.0587,0.0387,0.0406,0.0425,-0.0143,-0.0446,-0.0573,0.0756,0.0408,-0.1436,-0.0118,-0.059,-0.0136,-0.0406,0.0833,-0.1263,-0.0933,0.0429,0.0002,-0.0181,0.0707,-0.0189,-0.0463,-0.0726,0.0387,-0.0212,-0.1317,0.0571,0.0179,-0.0273,-0.1208,-0.1294,0.0685,0.0352,0.0823,-0.0234,0.2197,-0.0074,0.0343,-0.0112,-0.1509,-0.0037,0.0644,0.0037,-0.0467,0,-0.0038,-0.0521,-0.2009,0.0562,0.0794,0.0013,0.0068,-0.0186,-0.0707,0.0484,0.0533,0.1115,-0.0885,0.0391,0.1555,-0.1242,0.0764,0.1911,-0.0983,-0.055,-0.048,0.0993,0.0271,-0.0606,0.1603,0.1693,-0.0613,0.1074,-0.0661,-0.0003,-0.0483,0.0451,-0.0548,-0.0705,0.0071,-0.0057,-0.1129,-0.0218,0.0765,0.018,-0.0407,-0.0517,0.0465,-0.1014,0.0133,0.0204,0.0002,0.0458,0.0544,0.0247,0.0118,0.0788,0.0021,-0.1595,0.0933,-0.1131,-0.1643,0.0843,0.0971,0.1491,0.0187,-0.0093,0.0081,0.0226,-0.0363,0.0771,-0.0591,-0.0775,0.0563,-0.1017,-0.1104,0.0197,0.1264,0.0656,0.0589,-0.0496,-0.0042,-0.0888,-0.0952,-0.1078,-0.0547,0.0875,-0.0025,0.0475,-0.0044,-0.132,0.0597,-0.0189,-0.1899,-0.1815,-0.0896,-0.012,0.0506,-0.1004,-0.0265,0,0.0625,-0.0479,-0.0601,-0.0286,-0.1158,0.018,0.0818,0.0842,0.0326,-0.0933,0.0031,0.1723,0.0081,-0.1607,-0.1202,0.1676,-0.1195,0.0709,0.0644,0.0956,-0.0103,0.0029,0.0104,0.039,-0.0245,-0.0523,0.0302,0.0734,0.1203,-0.0736,0.0413,0.0266,-0.1181,0.0533,-0.0397,-0.1646,-0.0293,-0.0206,-0.1495,0.1867,0.1856,0.0298,0.0401,0.0315,-0.0086,0.1645,0.1035,-0.1013,-0.1899,-0.0309,0.0152,-0.1974,-0.0012,-0.0433,-0.0293,0.1045,-0.001,-0.0265,-0.0431,-0.0365,0.1244,0.0326,-0.0598,0.0904,0.1228,0.0617,-0.099,-0.0341,-0.0763,-0.0378,0.0102,-0.1506,0.0514,-0.16,-0.0037,0.0266,0.1106,-0.039,-0.0338,0.0064,-0.0618,0.0024,-0.0372,-0.0365,0.0267,0.2133,-0.0783,0.0857,0.0763,0.1024,-0.1089,0.0451,0.1782,0.105,-0.0888,0,-0.0173,0.0107,0.0038,-0.0852,-0.0067,-0.0281,0.0185,0.017,-0.0735,0.0453,0.0636,0.0338,-0.0607,0.0051,0.1075,0.129,-0.0687,0.1225,-0.0767,0.0351,0.0104,-0.0168,0.0248,0.0587,0.0422,0.093,-0.0756,0.0691,0.0339,0.0484,0.1285,0.0388,0.0721,-0.0004,-0.0123,-0.034,0.017,0.0119,0.041,0.1114,0.0218,-0.1553,-0.0532,0.0499,0.0479,-0.0254,0.0198,-0.0366,-0.038,-0.0126,-0.0968,0.0674,-0.0308,-0.0256,0.0563,0.0169,0.0935,0.0629,0.0458,-0.0049,0.0525,0.1065,-0.0169,0.0662],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdSettingsMenu.md [chunk 7]","tags":["prd","design-doc","how"],"version":1},

It also aligns with modern accessibility and responsive design standards.\n\n---\n\n## Settings Menu: User Flow\n\n- Player clicks “Settings” on the Navigation Bar or Navigation Map.\n- Settings page loads in ≤200ms.\n- Toggles/selectors pull values from settings.json and render current state.\n- Player makes changes → UI updates instantly → data writes within 50ms.\n- On error during update: Toggle reverts, then CSS popup error displayed\n- Player exits → settings persist for the rest of the session.\n- Player can open **Change Log** to view recent judoka updates.\n- Player can open **PRD Viewer** to read product requirement documents.\n- Player can open **Mockup Viewer** to browse design mockups.\n- The mockup viewer provides Next/Back controls for cycling through images and includes a Home link back to the main menu.\n\n---\n\n## UX & Accessibility\n\n- **Consistency:** Settings page must match the game’s visual identity, including fonts, colors, and button styles.\n- **Touch targets:** All toggles and selectors must have touch targets ≥44px (see [UI Design Standards](../codeStandards/codeUIDesignStandards.md#9-accessibility--responsiveness)).\n- **Accessibility:**\n  - Keyboard navigation: All interactive elements must be reachable with tab, with clear focus indicators.\n  - Screen reader support: Each toggle/selector must have appropriate ARIA labels describing function and current state.\n  - Color contrast: Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio in all display modes per WCAG 2.1.\n- **Interaction flow:**\n\n  - Tab order should proceed top-to-bottom: **display mode → sound → motion → game mode toggles**.\n  - Users can navigate and activate each control without needing a mouse.\n  - **Section layout:** The page begins with an `<h1>` heading followed by two `<fieldset>` sections—**General Settings** and *","qaContext":"5 Section toggles and content meet touch target and color contrast requirements.","embedding":[-0.1037,-0.0162,-0.0497,0.019,0.0651,0.1026,0.1214,0.0385,-0.0409,0.0758,0.0373,-0.0053,0.0396,-0.0065,0.0668,0.0329,0.0271,-0.0245,-0.0651,0.0971,0.0122,-0.1492,0.0436,-0.0903,-0.1322,0.0859,-0.0414,-0.0404,-0.1408,-0.1155,-0.0791,0.1127,0.0198,-0.041,-0.0654,-0.0848,0.0383,-0.0786,-0.1847,-0.0167,-0.1581,-0.008,0.0008,0.0698,0.0007,-0.0295,-0.0521,-0.0418,0.0166,0.0553,-0.0723,-0.0567,0.1045,-0.0607,0.0631,0.041,0.0062,0.0972,0.0695,0.0387,0.0164,-0.0689,0.0207,0.0612,0.0519,0.0129,0.0187,-0.0508,0.0299,-0.0752,-0.0852,0.0332,0.1406,-0.057,0.0218,-0.0475,-0.0086,-0.0195,-0.0681,-0.1792,0.027,-0.0346,-0.0521,0.0673,0.05,0.0075,0.0156,-0.0147,-0.0016,0.0558,-0.0497,-0.0335,-0.0248,-0.0514,-0.0054,-0.0279,0.0146,-0.1116,-0.0637,0.0336,0.0301,-0.0396,0.1213,0.0549,-0.0238,-0.1212,0.073,0.0533,-0.1251,0.089,0.0752,-0.006,-0.0678,-0.0857,0.0278,-0.0095,-0.0273,0.0164,0.1389,0.0721,0.1287,0.0398,-0.1147,-0.0894,0.0849,0.0171,0.0275,0,0.057,-0.1052,-0.1568,0.0503,0.0598,-0.0405,0.0307,-0.0516,-0.126,-0.012,0.0716,0.1282,-0.1093,0.0835,0.1061,-0.0637,-0.0232,0.0668,-0.0437,0.0122,0.0303,0.0139,-0.0639,-0.034,0.0525,0.2356,-0.0172,0.0791,0.0004,0.0306,-0.0743,-0.0003,-0.0312,-0.0446,-0.0132,-0.0118,-0.0814,-0.0412,0.0337,-0.0264,-0.0916,-0.0761,-0.0702,-0.0368,-0.0746,-0.0454,0.0519,0.0069,0.0422,0.008,-0.0653,0.0442,-0.053,-0.1656,0.0258,-0.1434,-0.0353,0.0792,0.0345,0.1057,0.0642,0.0467,0.0073,-0.0067,-0.0279,0.0845,0.0099,-0.0589,0.0048,-0.1194,-0.1503,0.0385,0.1207,0.0461,-0.0133,-0.0758,-0.0041,-0.0071,-0.0782,-0.0473,-0.0434,0.0028,-0.0494,0.0725,-0.0417,-0.0924,0.0681,-0.0455,-0.2268,-0.0761,0.008,0.0169,0.0371,-0.0761,-0.0452,0,0.0135,-0.0376,-0.1074,0.0772,-0.0305,-0.0194,0.1199,0.1747,0.1038,-0.072,0.0513,0.1121,-0.054,-0.0852,-0.079,0.1342,-0.0535,0.0001,-0.0708,0.0206,-0.0056,0.0454,0.0094,-0.019,-0.0529,0.0199,0.1366,0.0253,-0.0332,-0.0642,0.0684,0.0005,-0.1176,-0.0007,0.1082,-0.0899,0.0267,-0.0222,-0.1722,0.1349,0.1335,0.0213,0.0281,0.0001,0.0501,0.1993,0.026,-0.0704,-0.1128,-0.0516,0.0718,-0.1481,0.0825,-0.1461,-0.0135,0.0443,0.0096,-0.0449,0.0238,0.0726,0.1327,0.0121,-0.1311,0.0333,0.0479,0.142,-0.1181,-0.004,0.0234,-0.0263,-0.0891,-0.1572,0.1046,-0.1516,0.0374,0.0373,0.0519,-0.0181,0.0583,-0.0062,-0.0294,0.0516,0.0443,-0.0175,0.0788,0.1582,-0.1452,0.0848,0.0597,-0.001,-0.0815,0.0379,0.0952,0.0898,-0.0333,0,-0.0794,0.0079,0.033,-0.0316,0.0084,0.0109,0.0257,-0.058,-0.0283,0.0467,0.0848,0.0487,0.0122,0.0358,0.0644,0.0666,-0.0042,0.1261,-0.1256,-0.0069,0.0434,-0.0302,0.0257,0.0505,0.0234,0.0735,-0.1232,-0.0107,0.0728,-0.0434,0.0738,-0.0081,-0.0208,0.0146,-0.1163,0.0164,0.007,0.0531,0.0673,0.0962,-0.0266,-0.1568,-0.0677,0.0465,-0.084,-0.0456,0.0166,-0.1053,-0.0916,-0.003,-0.1296,0.0358,0.0002,0.032,0.1095,0.0377,0.1084,0.0201,-0.0006,-0.0147,0.0394,0.0266,-0.0378,0.0878],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdSettingsMenu.md [chunk 8]","tags":["prd","design-doc","how"],"version":1},

Transitions use the View Transitions API, falling back to immediate changes if unsupported.\n\n### Game Modes Toggles\n\n- AC-5.1 Toggling any game mode ON/OFF updates the IsHidden field in `settings.json` within 50ms.\n- AC-5.2 Each game mode toggle accurately reflects its state on page reload.\n- AC-5.3 If `navigationItems.json` is missing or invalid, the game modes list does not render, and an error message appears in the settings UI.\n\n### Advanced Settings & Feature Flag Info\n\n- Experimental and debug flags are grouped under a collapsible **Advanced Settings** section.\n- When a flag is toggled, a modal explains the feature using the description text from `featureFlags[flag].description`.\n- The modal is created via `createModal` with an OK button to dismiss it.\n- Debug-focused flags remain tucked away so younger players do not accidentally enable them.\n\n### Data Persistence & Refresh\n\n- AC-6.1 All settings changes persist through page refresh within the same session.\n- AC-6.2 Reopening `settings.html` shows the most up-to-date settings state from `settings.json`.\n\n### Error Handling & Feedback\n\n- AC-7.1 If reading `settings.json` fails, a CSS popup error message appears within 200ms.\n- AC-7.2 If writing to `settings.json` fails, a CSS popup error message appears within 200ms, and the toggle/selector reverts to its previous state.\n- AC-7.3 The settings screen remains stable and usable if an error occurs (no frozen or unresponsive UI).\n- AC-7.4 Successful changes display a snackbar con","qaContext":"ght/dark/gray) applies changes instantly across all relevant UI components.","embedding":[-0.1676,0.044,-0.0111,0.1361,0.0924,-0.0049,0.0596,0.0099,-0.0325,0.0297,0.0504,-0.0112,-0.0051,-0.0521,0.0496,0.0998,0.0649,-0.0889,-0.1174,-0.0208,0.064,-0.1435,-0.0455,-0.0964,-0.0317,0.0653,-0.0904,-0.0462,-0.0625,-0.0499,-0.1349,0.0828,-0.1452,0.0371,-0.0507,-0.0083,0.0407,-0.0765,-0.0252,-0.0029,-0.0539,0.0611,-0.0284,0.0225,-0.0224,-0.0768,-0.0748,-0.0579,-0.1068,0.0079,-0.0104,0.031,0.0807,-0.0407,0.0622,0.0809,0.0025,0.1461,0.0119,0.0794,-0.0102,-0.0983,-0.0413,0.0319,0.0225,0.0896,0.0672,-0.1704,0.0121,-0.0016,-0.0913,0.0309,0.0735,-0.0686,0.0452,-0.0588,-0.059,-0.0957,-0.038,-0.1725,0.0589,-0.0394,-0.0438,0.0046,0.0616,-0.0613,-0.0136,-0.0405,-0.0263,0.0708,-0.0713,-0.0562,0.0345,0.0309,-0.0086,0.0387,0.0815,-0.0863,-0.0298,0.0371,0,-0.0314,0.0666,0.1401,-0.0317,-0.0946,0.0558,0.1646,-0.1597,0.1097,-0.0132,0.0814,-0.043,-0.138,0.0566,0.0218,-0.0123,-0.0076,0.0893,0.0678,0.145,0.0197,0.0018,-0.0491,0.1666,-0.0091,0.0501,0,0.0298,-0.0804,-0.1092,0.0722,0.1012,0.0154,0.0328,-0.0152,-0.0096,0.0555,0.0862,0.1421,-0.0918,-0.0117,0.132,-0.1068,0.101,0.0028,0,-0.0305,0.0631,0.0759,-0.0022,-0.0487,0.0271,0.2259,-0.0335,0.1261,-0.1547,0.0015,0.0252,0.0312,-0.0166,-0.0061,0.0438,-0.0206,-0.033,-0.0351,-0.0079,-0.0252,-0.0869,-0.0167,-0.0994,0.0039,-0.0168,-0.1239,0.0058,0.0571,-0.0361,0.1102,-0.0385,0.1478,-0.0077,-0.1184,0.0031,-0.0684,-0.0923,0.0002,0.0651,0.0382,0.1244,-0.0387,-0.0325,-0.0745,-0.0298,0.1355,-0.0217,-0.0583,-0.0589,-0.0851,-0.0624,0.0329,0.136,0.0313,0.0658,-0.0706,-0.0724,0.0014,-0.1193,-0.1057,0.0756,-0.0218,-0.0504,0.034,-0.0441,-0.0969,0.0288,0.0019,-0.1631,-0.0219,0.0133,0.0292,0.1487,-0.0049,0.0093,0,0.0429,-0.1065,-0.0979,0.0894,-0.0226,-0.0754,0.0596,0.2339,0.0421,-0.13,0.0735,0.1444,-0.0781,-0.0721,-0.1485,0.1394,-0.1076,-0.0776,0.1057,0.0869,0.0633,0.0283,-0.0494,-0.0031,-0.0609,0.0307,0.0145,0.0311,0.03,-0.0381,0.1059,0.1062,-0.091,0.0675,0.06,-0.1296,-0.0166,-0.0121,-0.2375,0.0929,0.1579,0.065,-0.0087,0.0683,0.0807,0.1726,0.0641,-0.0315,-0.1185,-0.1089,0.0734,-0.1767,0.0157,-0.0762,0.028,0.0438,-0.0234,-0.0767,-0.0247,0.0709,0.1547,-0.0878,-0.1217,-0.001,0.0947,0.0745,-0.0997,0.0215,0.1436,-0.0088,0.0036,-0.1625,0.0178,-0.2326,-0.0374,-0.0321,0.0903,-0.1299,-0.0294,0.0452,-0.0971,-0.0129,-0.0274,-0.0431,-0.0375,0.1131,-0.1232,0.1398,0.0306,-0.0083,-0.1473,0.0233,0.0135,0.0926,-0.0484,0,-0.0867,0.0824,0.0312,-0.0876,0.0997,0.0443,0.0719,-0.0796,-0.0414,-0.0813,0.069,0.0986,0.0447,0.0311,0.0313,0.0193,-0.076,0.1088,-0.0453,0.057,-0.1073,-0.0091,0.0042,-0.0292,-0.0089,0.0493,0.0139,0.0414,0.0176,0.0395,-0.0879,0.0179,0.0883,-0.0478,-0.0634,0.0356,0.0752,-0.0113,0.1324,-0.0194,0.0743,-0.1075,-0.0705,0.064,-0.0384,-0.0694,0.0335,-0.0066,0.0144,0.0114,-0.0808,0.0342,-0.1696,0.0209,0.1493,-0.1126,0.0658,0.0011,0.0415,-0.0374,0.0675,-0.0626,-0.0062,-0.0033],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdSettingsMenu.md [chunk 21]","tags":["prd","design-doc","how"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdSettingsMenu.md-chunk-36","text":"## Collapsible Settings Sections\n\nTo improve organization and reduce visual clutter, the Settings Menu should present each major area (e.g., General Settings, Game Modes) as a collapsible section. By default, all sections are collapsed; users can expand a section by clicking or using the keyboard. This approach supports accessibility, scalability, and a cleaner user experience as more settings are added.\n\n### Functional Requirement\n\n- Each settings area is collapsed by default and can be expanded/collapsed by the user.\n- Section headers are keyboard-focusable and operable (Enter/Space).\n- ARIA attributes (`aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-labelledby`) are used for accessibility.\n- Only expanded sections are included in the tab order.\n- The implementation must meet all accessibility and performance requirements outlined elsewhere in this PRD.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n- AC-9.1 All settings areas are collapsed by default on page load.\n- AC-9.2 Clicking or pressing Enter/Space on a section header toggles its expanded/collapsed state and updates `aria-expanded`.\n- AC-9.3 When collapsed, section content is hidden from both view and tab order.\n- AC-9.4 When expanded, section content is visible and all controls are accessible via keyboard and screen reader.\n- AC-9.5 Section toggles and content meet touch target and color contrast requirements.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis pattern keeps the settings page organized and accessible, especially as more options are added.

She taps again, excitedly building a fresh team, and spends twice as long experimenting compared to when she built manually. The bright animations and satisfying feel keep her engaged.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nPlayers currently experience predictable, repetitive gameplay when they pre-select cards, leading to decreased engagement and shorter session times. Without randomness, team composition lacks inspiration and novelty, causing players to churn or lose interest more quickly.\n\n> _“I always pick the same cards because it’s easier. I get bored of my team really fast.” — 10-year-old player during playtest session_\n\n**Game data shows:** 35% of players who manually build teams exit the game within 5 minutes, while players using random draws play an average of 40% longer per session.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n- Give players quick inspiration for new team ideas (**random card ≤300 ms**)\n- Play sessions average 2 minutes shorter when pre-selecting cards; aim to close this gap\n- Reduce time-to-inspiration by 50% compared to manual team-building (reduce average team-building time from 30 seconds to ≤15 seconds)\n- Ensure each card draw completes in ≤300ms in 95% of cases\n- Achieve 95% error-free card draws across 1000 consecutive draws\n- ≥90% of random draws complete in ≤300ms on mid-tier devices\n- ≤1% fallback error rate over 1000 draws\n- Average time spent on Random Judoka screen ≥40% higher than average team-building time for players who only pre-select cards\n- ≥80% of players use the Draw button at leas","qaContext":"PRD: Display Random Judoka **Game Mode ID:** `12` **URL:** `randomJudoka.","embedding":[-0.0142,0.0914,0.0046,0.026,-0.0046,0.0502,0.1231,0.0847,0.1759,0.0129,-0.0371,-0.1332,0.0507,0.0689,0.079,-0.0231,0.1065,0.0555,-0.1014,0.0818,0.0237,-0.1815,0.084,0.0363,0.0096,-0.0347,-0.0183,-0.0494,-0.1236,-0.0695,-0.0805,0.1547,0.1206,-0.0586,-0.0425,0.0037,-0.0974,0.1108,-0.0314,-0.0562,-0.1835,-0.0637,0.0502,0.1025,0.0204,-0.0366,-0.0141,-0.0642,-0.0652,0.0577,-0.2241,0.0002,0.0149,0.0095,0.1475,-0.0519,0.0281,0.0166,-0.0284,0.0562,0.0295,-0.0209,-0.0339,0.0183,-0.0682,-0.1284,0.0489,0.1137,0.0537,0.0631,0.0027,0.0153,-0.0783,0.042,0.0912,0.1536,0.0057,-0.0693,0.0623,-0.1223,-0.0293,-0.0352,0.0339,0.0197,0.0153,-0.0356,0.1178,0.0566,0.0926,0.0092,0.0082,0.2068,0.0057,-0.0359,0.0829,0.0516,-0.017,-0.056,-0.0805,0.1274,-0.0032,0.021,0.1251,0.0842,0.0494,-0.0571,0.0797,0.0001,-0.0222,-0.0288,-0.0293,0.0359,-0.0971,0.056,-0.0605,0.1032,-0.1055,0.0213,-0.0069,0.1924,0.1378,-0.0757,0.0026,0.0206,0.0464,0.0382,-0.0015,0,0.061,-0.0818,-0.0444,0.0773,-0.0123,-0.0787,0.0333,-0.127,-0.0404,-0.0068,-0.0852,0.0018,0.0385,0.119,0.0746,-0.066,-0.1763,0.0551,-0.0421,0.0634,0.1424,0.0077,-0.0075,-0.0919,-0.0264,0.1596,-0.0362,-0.129,-0.0349,0.0629,-0.0656,-0.0599,-0.1239,-0.0981,-0.1037,-0.0557,0.0763,-0.0633,-0.0557,0.0443,-0.143,-0.0486,-0.0105,-0.0325,0.0211,-0.1169,-0.0032,0.0053,-0.0928,0.1025,-0.0325,0.0292,0.1345,0.0114,0.0046,-0.0236,0.123,-0.0311,-0.0377,0.1245,-0.056,-0.0054,-0.1842,0.0862,0.0233,0.0434,0.013,-0.0695,0.0978,-0.0756,-0.0596,0.0082,0.0184,-0.0418,-0.1272,-0.1259,0.0742,0.1098,-0.0892,-0.0264,0.0531,0.0059,-0.155,-0.099,-0.0354,0.0951,0.0835,-0.1312,-0.2046,0.1179,-0.0203,0.0375,0.0306,0.0863,-0.025,0,-0.0696,-0.0811,-0.0261,0.1093,0.1794,-0.0242,0.0653,-0.0042,0.0583,-0.1454,-0.0393,-0.0254,-0.0864,0.0161,-0.0055,-0.0731,0.0947,0.025,-0.1516,0.0661,0.1353,0.1134,-0.0542,-0.0516,-0.0103,0.0772,0.0424,-0.0296,-0.0202,-0.0343,-0.0232,-0.0521,-0.1148,0.0021,0.0476,-0.0903,-0.0438,-0.0249,-0.0589,0.1505,0.1263,0.0426,-0.0671,0.0798,0.0284,0.113,-0.024,-0.0976,0.008,0.0149,0.0463,-0.034,-0.1537,-0.11,-0.0646,-0.1379,0.0061,-0.0995,0.0222,0.1108,-0.0039,-0.0057,-0.0344,-0.0781,0.0896,0.0585,-0.0988,-0.0208,0.0199,0.0276,-0.0762,0.0905,-0.1401,-0.0518,0.0509,0.0801,-0.1281,0.0603,0.0564,-0.0807,-0.1173,0.0418,-0.0122,-0.0792,-0.0124,0.1582,-0.1029,0.0528,0.0618,-0.0168,0.0402,0.0099,0.1454,0.1011,0.0079,0,-0.0067,0.0469,0.0396,0.0576,0.1025,0.0703,-0.1042,-0.0585,-0.0023,-0.0524,0.3078,0.0716,-0.0206,-0.0027,0.079,-0.0512,-0.0251,0.1123,-0.1183,0.009,0.0255,-0.0455,-0.1132,-0.1431,-0.1856,-0.0376,-0.0735,0.0246,0.0158,-0.1139,0.0454,-0.032,-0.0325,0.049,-0.0199,0.0468,0.0303,-0.0537,-0.0374,0.1074,-0.0858,-0.082,-0.0336,-0.033,0.0062,-0.0619,-0.1104,-0.2152,-0.0114,-0.1177,-0.0516,-0.1156,-0.0707,0.0165,0.1199,0.1449,0.0794,-0.0242,0.0183,0.026,0.0949,-0.0018,-0.1532,0.0078],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdRandomJudoka.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdRandomJudoka.md-chunk-15","text":"## UI Design\n\n### Design and UX Considerations\n\n#### Layout and Interaction\n\n- **Main Screen Structure:**\n  - **Card Display Area:** Centered large card placeholder with dynamic content\n  - **Action Buttons:**\n    - Prominent “Draw Card!” button below the card, centered, clear label\n- **Draw Flow:**\n  1.

{"id":"prdPseudoJapanese.md-chunk-1","text":"# PRD: Pseudo-Japanese Text Conversion Function\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThis PRD defines a Pseudo-Japanese Text Conversion Function for Ju-Do-Kon!’s meditation screen. By instantly toggling quotes between English and simulated Japanese aesthetics, it deepens immersion without requiring players to read real Japanese. The feature includes a performant local mapping system, fallback strategies, and a fast, intuitive toggle (**switch within 200 ms**).\n\n> After an intense battle, Mia opens the meditation screen. She taps the toggle — the quote transforms into stylized Japanese script, beautifully rendered in Mincho font. Though she doesn’t read Japanese, the aesthetic transports her to the spirit of judo, deepening her connection to the game.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nAs this game is about a Japanese martial art, authentic cultural immersion is key to the user experience. However, Japanese is complex, and most players are not literate in it. This language barrier prevents players from fully appreciating the cultural setting and diminishes the sense of authenticity.\n\n> Players unfamiliar with Japanese miss the authentic cultural feel. Translating to pseudo-Japanese bridges this gap by simulating the aesthetics without creating a comprehension barrier.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n- Improve immersion by simulating Japanese aesthetics, enhancing players’ perception of authenticity, without requiring them to read or understand real Japanese.\n- Achieve a 90% success rate in API text conversion without errors.\n- Ensure local JSON fallback conversion completes within 500ms.\n- Toggle feature allows players to switch between original English text and pseudo-Japanese output, with response times under 200ms.\n- Support input text up to 999 characters without degradation of performance.\n- Provide an authentic-feeling Japanese aesthetic without requiring language proficiency.\n- Enable quick, easy switching between English and pseudo-Japanese text (**toggle ≤200 ms**).\n\n---\n## Non-Goals\n\n- No real Japane","qaContext":"PRD: Pseudo-Japanese Text Conversion Function --- ## TL;DR This PRD defines a Pseudo-Japanese Text Conversion Function for Ju-Do-Kon!","embedding":[-0.1041,0.0779,0.0104,-0.02,-0.0413,0.065,0.1403,0.049,0.1374,0.0131,0.1455,-0.1043,0.0997,0.0321,0.1248,0.0114,0.0749,0.1342,-0.0935,-0.0538,0.0604,-0.0891,0.0444,0.0559,0.0617,0.0485,-0.0604,0.0815,-0.0351,0.0267,-0.1762,0.1518,0.0865,-0.0449,0.0074,0.1648,-0.0106,0.0322,-0.061,-0.1526,-0.2206,-0.0174,0.0337,0.0632,0.2064,-0.0147,-0.1056,0.0088,-0.0701,0.0026,-0.2456,0.0133,0.0054,-0.0195,0.011,0.0335,0.0394,0.1455,-0.0122,0.1124,-0.1318,-0.0637,0.0516,0.1,0.0423,-0.1039,0.0306,-0.0234,-0.0386,0.0418,-0.0683,0.0002,0.1066,0.0803,-0.0163,0.0197,-0.024,-0.1176,-0.0384,-0.0993,0.058,0.0351,0.0113,0.0464,-0.0021,0.0109,-0.0163,-0.0699,0.1185,0.1388,-0.11,-0.0222,0.0325,0.0835,-0.0415,0.0123,-0.0625,0.0653,-0.0583,0.0807,0.0759,0.0664,0.0382,-0.122,-0.0646,-0.0996,0.0867,-0.0268,-0.0502,-0.0473,0.0424,-0.0219,-0.1133,-0.0717,-0.0139,0.0525,0.0712,-0.1115,0.1187,0.085,0.0257,-0.0526,-0.0455,0.0382,0.0496,0.0005,0.041,0,0.0717,0.0926,-0.0067,0.0284,-0.1595,-0.0991,-0.0568,-0.1297,-0.0617,-0.0162,-0.0844,0.0204,-0.1075,0.0683,0.0936,-0.114,-0.0678,0.0493,0.0505,0.0248,0.1496,0.0413,-0.0196,-0.0463,-0.0756,0.1964,0.0968,-0.1304,-0.1335,0.1027,-0.1441,-0.133,-0.054,-0.0774,-0.0273,-0.1125,0.1811,-0.0811,0.003,0.1236,-0.1163,-0.0037,-0.0211,0.054,-0.011,-0.0009,0.0676,-0.0265,-0.0758,0.0981,-0.1463,0.0456,0.1141,0.0381,0.0547,-0.0625,0.1915,-0.0818,-0.0351,0.1096,-0.0601,-0.0394,-0.0692,0.151,0.0889,0.0622,-0.0167,-0.2544,-0.0068,-0.1042,-0.1986,0.0353,-0.0117,0.0202,-0.1195,-0.1569,0.0404,0.0275,0.146,-0.0666,-0.0281,0.0001,-0.1807,0.1069,0.0486,0.011,0.1126,-0.1731,-0.113,-0.0682,0.0983,-0.0047,0.0925,-0.0694,-0.0177,0,-0.0298,0.0603,-0.1249,0.1725,-0.0748,-0.0329,0.0749,0.1606,0.1076,-0.164,-0.0626,-0.0245,0.0051,-0.0267,-0.1322,-0.0136,0.1223,0.1081,-0.0589,0.1574,0.0968,0.1301,-0.1027,-0.0267,-0.059,0.1288,0.0096,0.0836,-0.0036,0.07,0.07,-0.0016,-0.1635,-0.0078,-0.0584,-0.0408,-0.0007,0.0581,-0.1292,0.1436,0.118,-0.0006,-0.1175,0.0103,-0.1377,0.1067,-0.174,-0.133,-0.0654,-0.0518,0.1011,-0.0819,0.0256,-0.1398,-0.1424,-0.2393,-0.0513,-0.1107,-0.0633,0.0458,0.0991,-0.1023,0.0004,-0.0999,0.0577,-0.0009,0.0911,0.1195,-0.0058,-0.0902,0.0621,-0.0837,0.0387,0.0086,0.0011,-0.0457,-0.0039,-0.0027,0.0909,0.0683,-0.0012,0.0653,-0.012,0.0143,0.1456,0.2624,-0.2533,0.0998,0.0518,-0.0078,-0.0195,0.2227,-0.0017,0.0647,-0.0719,0,-0.1223,-0.1814,0.0289,0.0486,-0.0519,0.0077,-0.109,-0.145,-0.0238,-0.1493,0.1534,0.0861,-0.0358,-0.0249,-0.0254,0.1171,0.1019,0.245,-0.0826,0.0708,-0.0084,0.0486,-0.1356,-0.1576,-0.102,0.1443,-0.1738,0.0685,0.0755,-0.1474,0.0796,-0.0124,-0.0149,0.0591,-0.1117,0.0698,0.0781,0.0095,-0.1012,0.126,0.0377,-0.1162,-0.1323,0.038,0.0028,-0.0506,0.04,-0.2042,0.0344,-0.0525,0.0846,-0.0838,-0.0618,-0.0065,0.0445,0.0574,0.1579,0.0876,-0.0181,0.2088,0.095,0.149,-0.0845,0.0056],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdPseudoJapanese.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

Quote Display + Language Toggle Module\n\n**Contents:**\n\n- Quote block with dynamic font and max-width.\n- Enlarged language toggle button (“日本語 / English”) above or below the quote.\n- 200ms fade animation when language is toggled using the `.fading` CSS class.\n\n**Why:**\nEnhances contextual clarity and smooth interaction, keeping actions tied to relevant content.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Action Button Module\n\n**Contents:**\n\n- Large, thumb-friendly “Continue Your Journey” button.\n- Clear visual separation from quote/toggle above.\n\n**Why:**\nPrevents accidental taps and creates distinct flow—finish reading before proceeding.\n\n---\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Local JSON mapping file for English-to-pseudo-Japanese conversion ([pseudoJapaneseMap.json](../../data/pseudoJapaneseMap.json) if present; see repo for details).\n- Validation API: [https://romaji2kana.com/api](https://romaji2kana.com/api) (testing only, not production).\n- Integrated with the Meditation screen ([PRD: Meditation Screen](prdMeditationScreen.md)).\n\n---\n\n\n## Player Flow\n\n1. Player opens meditation screen → quote displays in English by default.\n2. Player taps toggle button → text fades to pseudo-Japanese in ≤200ms.\n3.

By instantly toggling quotes between English and simulated Japanese aesthetics, it deepens immersion without requiring players to read real Japanese. The feature includes a performant local mapping system, fallback strategies, and a fast, intuitive toggle (**switch within 200 ms**).\n\n> After an intense battle, Mia opens the meditation screen. She taps the toggle — the quote transforms into stylized Japanese script, beautifully rendered in Mincho font. Though she doesn’t read Japanese, the aesthetic transports her to the spirit of judo, deepening her connection to the game.\n\n---","qaContext":"TL;DR This PRD defines a Pseudo-Japanese Text Conversion Function for Ju-Do-Kon!","embedding":[-0.1408,0.0897,0.0718,-0.0226,-0.0046,0.1447,0.1745,0.0023,0.1969,-0.0672,0.117,-0.002,0.0279,-0.0362,0.0563,0.0325,0.0806,0.1283,-0.0267,-0.0177,-0.0055,-0.0287,0.079,0.1423,0.1129,0.122,-0.0641,0.0667,-0.0018,0.1076,-0.1776,0.127,0.0392,-0.0249,0.0416,0.1526,0.1027,0.0045,0.006,-0.1104,-0.1565,0.0283,0.0181,0.0774,0.2496,-0.0718,-0.0443,-0.0059,0.0706,-0.0316,-0.2944,-0.018,0.0875,-0.077,-0.0379,0.0717,0.0664,0.2118,0.1029,0.2018,-0.1,0.0243,0.048,0.1581,0.0714,-0.1732,0.0162,-0.0295,-0.0936,-0.0782,-0.0609,-0.06,0.1911,0.0121,-0.0767,0.0208,0.0403,-0.1759,0.023,-0.074,0.0489,-0.0233,0.007,0.0575,-0.0352,0.0555,-0.0408,-0.1826,0.1258,0.1681,-0.0858,-0.1304,-0.0945,0.0622,-0.2303,-0.0042,-0.1836,0.1542,-0.011,0.1258,0.1525,0.1136,0.1001,-0.1386,-0.1391,-0.153,0.1892,-0.0958,-0.0198,-0.0656,0.0262,-0.0802,-0.0991,-0.0619,-0.0433,0.0269,0.0912,-0.2274,0.0024,0.0766,0.0265,-0.1912,-0.1362,0.0393,0.035,0.0481,-0.0342,0,0.1445,-0.0113,0.1186,0.0136,-0.1245,-0.1184,-0.1029,-0.2008,-0.1009,-0.0079,-0.1294,-0.1116,-0.0873,0.0553,0.0146,-0.1539,-0.1892,0.0106,0.1356,-0.0441,0.1049,0.1262,-0.0496,-0.0289,-0.1361,0.2611,0.1326,-0.0849,-0.1103,0.1318,-0.1305,-0.0569,-0.0424,-0.0937,-0.0806,-0.0692,0.0798,-0.0139,0.0984,0.2212,-0.1072,0.0042,0.0371,0.1011,-0.1256,0.0671,0.0196,-0.0674,0.0685,0.0453,-0.2275,-0.1151,0.1264,0.1173,0.1295,-0.01,0.2007,-0.0861,-0.0175,0.0462,-0.1538,-0.0921,-0.0861,0.1516,0.1504,0.0508,-0.0296,-0.3206,0.0375,-0.1002,-0.2008,0.0926,-0.0501,0.0194,-0.1333,-0.1754,-0.0197,0.0253,0.1457,-0.0253,0.0166,-0.034,-0.0936,0.1959,0.0311,-0.0651,-0.0289,-0.1575,-0.121,-0.0631,0.1996,0.005,0.1025,-0.2193,-0.1039,0,-0.0068,0.1081,-0.1261,0.1327,-0.0987,0.0143,0.0033,0.2297,0.0493,-0.1061,-0.0343,-0.1005,0.0895,-0.0211,-0.1504,0.0181,0.1391,0.0762,-0.0826,0.0314,0.1253,-0.0141,-0.0224,-0.0218,-0.005,0.0799,0.0952,0.0757,0.0079,0.1318,0.0268,-0.0798,-0.1559,0.0533,-0.0188,-0.0292,-0.0269,0.0043,-0.1717,-0.0125,0.1018,-0.0247,-0.0605,0.0368,-0.0961,0.126,-0.3036,-0.0643,-0.0476,-0.0498,0.0218,-0.1009,0.0184,-0.1594,-0.1392,-0.2808,-0.0807,-0.0165,-0.046,0.0638,0.0829,-0.1218,-0.0977,-0.1585,0.0534,0.012,0.2169,0.097,0.0056,-0.1205,0.1708,-0.113,-0.0595,0.0601,-0.0358,-0.0126,0.0289,0.025,0.0256,0.1185,0.0684,-0.0483,-0.02,0.056,0.2381,0.3151,-0.2702,0.0597,-0.002,0.0584,-0.0093,0.182,0.0491,0.0187,-0.0885,0,-0.1405,-0.2683,0.0478,-0.0407,-0.1429,0.0035,-0.0524,-0.0881,-0.0628,-0.0735,0.1688,0.111,0.0272,0.0754,0.0202,0.1146,0.1087,0.278,-0.0379,0.0904,-0.0098,-0.0118,0.0109,-0.1583,-0.0835,0.1995,-0.2251,0.1901,0.03,-0.14,0.1003,0.0596,-0.0111,0.007,-0.2704,0.0906,0.0065,-0.0331,-0.1672,0.1171,-0.058,-0.1968,-0.134,0.0466,-0.0253,-0.0449,0.2029,-0.1699,0.0498,-0.0859,0.1374,-0.1162,0.0413,-0.0541,-0.0009,0.0468,0.2136,0.0892,-0.0036,0.2413,0.118,0.1899,-0.1182,-0.0314],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdPseudoJapanese.md [chunk 7]","tags":["prd","design-doc","what"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdPRDViewer.md-chunk-1","text":"# PRD: PRD Viewer\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThe PRD Viewer is a browser-based tool that enables JU-DO-KON! contributors and stakeholders to read, browse, and validate Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) directly within the web application. It provides a user-friendly interface for sequentially viewing all PRDs, supporting keyboard and touch navigation, and rendering markdown content as styled HTML.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nContributors currently face difficulty reviewing PRDs because they must clone the repository or navigate raw markdown files manually. As one contributor shared:\n\n> \"Sometimes I spend more time hunting down the right markdown file than actually understanding the requirements.\"\n\nNon-technical stakeholders struggle even more with raw markdown formatting, leading to misunderstandings and delayed implementations. A dedicated PRD Viewer tool ensures everyone can easily access up-to-date requirements and acceptance criteria in a readable format, improving collaboration and reducing errors.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Enable in-browser reading of all PRDs in the `design/productRequirementsDocuments` directory.\n- Support intuitive navigation (buttons, keyboard, swipe) between documents.\n- Render markdown PRDs as readable, styled HTML with tables, code blocks, and headings.\n- Ensure accessibility and responsive design for all users.\n- Achieve markdown rendering performance with document switches completing within 200ms on standard desktop devices.\n\n## User Stories\n\n- As a developer, I want to quickly browse all PRDs in sequence so that I can understand feature requirements without searching the repo.\n- As a designer, I want to view PRDs with proper formatting and tables so that I can review acceptance criteria and requirements clearly.\n- As a product manager, I want to verify that each PRD is present and up-to-date so that I can track project completeness.\n- As any user, I want to easily exit the viewer to the homepage or previous page, so I never feel stuck.\n\n## Defined Player Actions ","qaContext":"PRD: PRD Viewer ## TL;DR The PRD Viewer is a browser-based tool that enables JU-DO-KON!","embedding":[-0.1327,0.0163,-0.0651,-0.0177,0.1535,0.0317,0.024,0.0866,-0.0275,0.0982,-0.0182,0.0432,0.0671,0.0256,-0.0128,-0.0017,0.0169,0.0669,-0.0202,0.1058,-0.0043,-0.0327,0.0252,-0.0167,-0.087,-0.0371,0.0404,-0.0885,-0.0915,-0.0097,0.0465,-0.0075,-0.0141,-0.0608,0.0994,0.0916,0.0408,-0.0994,-0.147,-0.1023,-0.107,0.0069,-0.0823,-0.0072,0.0093,-0.1918,-0.0563,-0.0858,-0.0986,0.0259,-0.1683,-0.0374,-0.0111,-0.1243,-0.0427,0.0359,-0.012,-0.1087,-0.0662,-0.0029,-0.0123,-0.0343,-0.0493,-0.0401,0.0735,0.1049,0.0671,0.0283,0.0706,-0.0384,-0.1715,0.026,0.0417,-0.0247,0.0007,-0.0279,-0.0284,-0.0107,-0.1069,-0.3022,0.0431,0.1462,-0.0409,0.1119,-0.0367,-0.0284,0.0949,0.0065,0.0681,0.0674,-0.0169,-0.0296,0.0657,0.0164,-0.0209,0.0087,0.0697,-0.0888,0.0591,0.0959,-0.0816,0.0675,0.0712,-0.1775,-0.0955,-0.0432,0.0191,0.0702,-0.0742,0.0093,0.0061,-0.0092,-0.1916,-0.1279,0.0701,-0.0772,-0.0353,-0.0498,0.2135,0.021,0.0686,0.1648,0.0061,0.0904,0.1811,-0.05,0.0628,0,0.105,-0.0497,-0.1072,0.052,0.044,0.0188,-0.005,0.0147,-0.1301,-0.0704,0.1727,0.0346,-0.0841,0.0446,0.0964,-0.0679,-0.0704,0.1746,-0.0392,0.0023,-0.0711,-0.0773,-0.0147,0.0367,0.1422,0.1445,-0.0374,0.1353,-0.0702,-0.0053,0.1305,-0.1005,-0.0757,-0.1344,-0.0862,0.0497,-0.1059,-0.0998,0.0835,-0.0299,-0.102,-0.0766,0.0413,0.0065,-0.1079,-0.0463,0.0037,0.0661,-0.0061,-0.0217,-0.0533,0.0379,0.0917,-0.0566,-0.0642,-0.1522,-0.0015,-0.0155,0.1633,0.1509,-0.0069,0.138,-0.0682,-0.021,-0.1903,0.0383,-0.0103,0.0195,0.0936,-0.0625,-0.239,0.0437,0.1329,-0.1045,0.0896,-0.0852,-0.0582,-0.0102,0.0708,0.0007,-0.0992,0.0403,-0.0061,0.0343,0.0496,-0.1256,-0.0422,-0.0552,-0.1242,-0.0387,0.0338,-0.011,-0.0411,0.0037,0.0534,0,0.0093,-0.051,0.0202,0.0456,-0.0274,-0.0559,-0.0782,0.041,0.0413,-0.1486,-0.0269,-0.0786,-0.079,-0.0431,-0.1577,0.1472,-0.0734,-0.1731,0.055,0.0411,-0.0046,0.1796,-0.0218,0.0431,0.0213,0.0478,0.1122,-0.0142,0.0019,-0.0479,0.0936,-0.0447,-0.1819,-0.0851,-0.0937,-0.1662,-0.0414,0.0902,-0.0163,0.1513,0.1444,0.0205,0.0216,0.0431,-0.0117,0.0868,0.0179,0.0112,0.0464,0.0009,-0.0275,0.0273,0.1363,-0.1555,-0.0404,-0.0864,-0.0638,0.0045,-0.0005,0.0058,0.0628,0.0496,0.0896,0.0875,0.0403,-0.0823,-0.0176,-0.034,-0.0813,-0.0007,-0.081,-0.0252,-0.0251,-0.1405,0.1283,-0.0135,0.0348,0.0274,0.0758,0.0691,0.0788,0.0608,0.0028,-0.0501,0.0479,0.152,-0.1606,0.0547,0.0286,0.0024,-0.0842,0.0906,0.0696,0.1499,0.0425,0,-0.0562,0.0282,-0.0352,-0.0986,0.0018,-0.0067,-0.0544,0.0714,-0.0799,-0.0703,0.1627,-0.0245,-0.1272,0.0269,0.0051,0.0433,0.0301,0.0969,-0.1658,0.0523,0.0195,0.0485,-0.0711,0.1263,0.0987,0.0506,0.0601,0.0175,0.0236,-0.0682,0.1081,0.0103,-0.025,0.0271,0.1472,0.0472,0.1047,0.075,0.0443,0.1412,-0.0318,-0.0291,-0.0043,0.0148,-0.0227,-0.0913,-0.0818,-0.0808,-0.0471,-0.0803,-0.1301,-0.1759,-0.021,0.0584,-0.0235,0.1316,0.1197,0.0583,0.02,0.0937,0.141,0.0285,0.0015,0.2034],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdPRDViewer.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

(See attached visual reference.)\n\n## Edge Cases / Failure States\n\n- **Markdown File Fails to Load:** Log error, show fallback message (“Content unavailable”), continue allowing navigation of others.\n- **Malformed Markdown Content:** Display partial content with warning icon and accessible tooltip.\n- **Slow Network or File Load Delay:** Show a loading spinner or status message while fetching files.\n- **Swipe Misfires on Touch Devices:** Use minimum gesture thresholds and debounce timing to avoid accidental navigations.\n- **Keyboard Navigation Blocked:** Ensure `tabindex`, role attributes, and focus management are correctly implemented.\n\n## Dependencies and Open Questions\n\n- Depends on the `markdownToHtml` helper for markdown parsing (uses the `marked` library).\n- Requires an up-to-date file list from the `design/productRequirementsDocuments` directory.\n- **Open:** Should the viewer support deep-linking to specific PRDs via URL hash or query parameters? This affects navigation and state restoration.\n\n## Mockups / Visual Reference\n\n- Header with clickable JU-DO-KON! logo (links Home), page title, and Prev/Next navigation buttons.\n- Large scrollable markdown-rendered content area.\n- Warning badge in content area if markdown partially rendered.\n- Bottom footer with keyboard and swipe navigation instructions.\n- Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile.\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] 1.0 Set Up Markdown File Loader\n\n  -","qaContext":"uirements / Design Considerations - The viewer must use the site’s base styles and support high-contrast mode for accessibility.","embedding":[-0.112,-0.0159,0.0542,0.0004,0.0884,0.0053,0.0133,0.0683,-0.0693,0.0332,0.0252,0.0478,0.0502,-0.0127,-0.0578,0.0129,0.0537,0.0265,-0.0349,0.0889,0.1066,-0.1001,-0.0024,-0.0788,-0.067,0.0262,-0.1007,-0.0744,-0.1049,-0.1204,-0.0409,0.0488,-0.0184,-0.079,-0.034,-0.0315,0.073,-0.1137,-0.1133,-0.0549,-0.08,0.0372,0.0293,-0.0104,0.0052,-0.1337,-0.0241,-0.087,-0.0049,0.0629,-0.104,-0.0076,0.0355,-0.0125,0.0254,0.0339,-0.0552,0.0034,0.0294,0.073,0.0423,-0.0053,0.0643,0.008,0.1358,0.0353,0.0185,-0.1128,0.024,-0.0314,-0.1407,-0.0644,0.0705,0.0235,-0.0496,-0.038,0.0146,0.0298,-0.0942,-0.259,0.0101,-0.0107,-0.026,0.0564,0.0159,-0.0021,0.032,-0.0645,0.0062,0.0447,0.0397,-0.0618,-0.0007,-0.0361,0.048,-0.0393,0.0173,-0.0798,-0.0766,0.0935,-0.0001,0.0192,0.1476,-0.0233,-0.0752,-0.0244,0.0737,0.0095,-0.1517,0.0529,0.0502,-0.0035,-0.0956,-0.1306,0.0712,-0.1113,-0.0085,-0.0403,0.1783,0.0386,0.0913,0.0264,-0.1274,-0.0924,0.0925,-0.0259,0.0224,0,0.0845,-0.0738,-0.1678,0.0078,0.1121,-0.0589,-0.0055,-0.0309,-0.1749,-0.0359,0.0938,0.041,-0.0598,0.0769,0.0964,-0.0961,-0.037,0.0168,-0.0138,-0.0206,0.0379,-0.1006,-0.0878,-0.0021,0.0611,0.2045,-0.0235,0.0774,-0.0385,-0.0016,-0.041,-0.0452,-0.0224,-0.1346,-0.0738,-0.036,-0.0966,-0.0531,0.0564,-0.0504,-0.101,-0.0615,-0.0333,0.0159,-0.0646,-0.0074,0.0802,0.0112,0.0432,0.0429,-0.0512,-0.0862,0.0027,-0.0912,-0.0115,-0.0405,-0.0553,0.0583,0.0859,0.1832,0.0283,-0.0244,-0.0365,-0.0139,-0.0165,0.0719,0.0385,-0.01,0.0255,-0.1173,-0.1817,-0.03,0.2467,0.0505,0.0398,-0.0672,-0.0733,-0.065,-0.0466,-0.027,-0.0687,-0.0419,0.0373,0.0063,0.0716,-0.1214,0.0127,-0.1176,-0.1562,-0.0495,-0.0284,-0.0052,0.0604,-0.0394,-0.0672,0,0.0523,0.0334,-0.0551,0.0937,-0.1123,0.0086,0.0967,0.1162,-0.0024,-0.1307,0.0009,0.0783,0.0108,-0.0713,-0.1056,0.1625,-0.0184,-0.11,-0.0627,0.0327,0.0438,0.1157,-0.0565,0.0264,0.0031,0.0329,0.1536,0.0092,-0.0062,-0.1162,0.0896,0.0089,-0.1258,-0.0519,0.0744,-0.0661,0.0166,-0.0531,-0.1152,0.077,0.2203,0.0533,0.0827,0.0083,0.0675,0.1293,-0.032,0.0394,-0.099,0.0055,0.0312,-0.1176,0.0533,-0.0661,0.0109,0.0155,0.0281,0.0031,-0.0097,0.0565,0.089,0.0021,-0.0469,-0.0152,0.0752,0.0187,-0.0518,0.0101,0.0073,0.0495,-0.078,-0.0585,0.1717,-0.1319,0.1324,0.0121,0.1392,-0.0175,0.0378,-0.0472,0.0366,0.0804,-0.0093,-0.0456,0.0711,0.1585,-0.1801,0.125,0.0512,0.0024,-0.1207,0.022,0.0715,0.1062,-0.0189,0,-0.0222,0.0576,-0.0261,-0.0905,0.0206,0.0727,0.0421,0.0059,-0.0403,-0.0312,0.1385,-0.005,-0.0819,0.0508,0.0092,0.0747,0.0183,0.1759,-0.1027,-0.0456,-0.0038,0.0216,-0.006,0.0993,0.0457,0.0863,0.0077,0.0557,-0.0004,-0.0501,0.0494,0.0377,0.0172,-0.0631,-0.0087,0.0875,0.017,0.0843,0.1054,0.1165,0.0088,-0.0252,0.0159,-0.0515,-0.0585,-0.0667,-0.1375,-0.0384,0.0011,-0.0142,-0.1033,-0.0499,-0.0216,0.0511,0.0812,-0.0369,0.1165,0.0059,0.0197,0.0695,0.1745,0.0075,-0.0365,0.104],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdPRDViewer.md [chunk 4]","tags":["prd","design-doc","how"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdNavigationMap.md-chunk-1","text":"# PRD: Navigation Map (Expanded Map View)\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThis PRD defines an immersive, thematic expanded map view for Ju-Do-Kon!’s navigation, transforming mode selection into a “Judo Training Village” experience. It improves discovery of new modes, reduces confusion, and deepens immersion, with fallback and accessibility options to ensure seamless, inclusive navigation across devices.\n\n> Mei finishes a match and taps the glowing map icon. The Judo Training Village slides up, revealing the Dojo (training hall), Budokan (martial arts arena), and Kodokan (judo headquarters) — each beautifully rendered and inviting. She feels transported into a living judo world, exploring new modes with excitement and confidence.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nPlayers have reported that the current navigation menus feel disconnected from the Ju-Do-Kon! theme, which weakens immersion and reduces excitement when switching game modes. A theoretical 10-year-old playtester noted:\n\n> \"The menu feels boring compared to the rest of the game — can it look more exciting? Maybe like a judo dojo or village?\"\n\nCurrently, the menu is purely functional but lacks the thematic cohesion that draws players deeper into the Ju-Do-Kon! world. Additionally, important new modes are hard to find because the plain menu structure buries them below a list format, making discovery harder for players. Improving the navigation’s thematic fit is important now because new game modes have been added, and players are not easily discovering them through the existing menu.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n- Make switching modes exciting and intuitive, matching the game’s theme.\n- Allow quick, frustration-free discovery of all game modes (**reach destination in ≤3 s**).\n\n---\n## Non-Goals\n\n- No dynamic pathfinding or open-world navigation beyond the village map.\n- Does not introduce multiplayer map interactions.\n- Excludes voice-over or cutscene content.\n\n---\n\n## User Stories\n\n- As a new player, I want the navigation to feel like part of th","qaContext":"PRD: Navigation Map (Expanded Map View) --- ## TL;DR This PRD defines an immersive, thematic expanded map view for Ju-Do-Kon!","embedding":[0.0361,0.0531,0.0655,-0.0647,0.0585,0.0484,0.0576,-0.0569,0.0379,0.0542,0.0352,-0.1157,0.0692,0.0202,0.1185,-0.0248,0.1151,0.086,0.0187,0.0155,0.0327,-0.0473,0.0609,0.0101,-0.1207,0.0275,0.04,0.0268,-0.1312,-0.0497,-0.0506,0.2172,0.0232,-0.0391,-0.0967,0.0818,-0.0133,0.0443,-0.0974,-0.0245,-0.1437,0.0769,0.0502,0.0374,0.1439,-0.0489,-0.0254,-0.1018,-0.0107,0.0359,-0.1492,-0.1451,0.0397,-0.0432,0.1095,0.0825,-0.0962,0.0504,0.0305,0.0619,0.0218,0.0398,-0.0259,0.0106,0.0825,-0.1595,0.0165,0.1099,-0.0015,0.0079,0.0685,-0.0622,0.071,-0.0119,0.0674,0.0418,-0.0963,-0.0131,-0.0951,-0.1557,0.0811,0.0642,-0.0304,-0.0523,-0.0502,-0.048,0.0183,-0.1229,0.075,0.0642,-0.0169,-0.0089,-0.0092,-0.0388,0.0593,-0.053,-0.1026,0.0358,-0.0248,0.1151,0.0214,0.0657,0.0999,-0.0016,-0.0037,-0.0624,0.0705,0.0474,-0.0974,0.1041,-0.0432,-0.0573,-0.0245,-0.0772,-0.0878,0.064,-0.0121,0.0335,0.0257,0.2124,0.0684,-0.1043,0.0465,0.0247,-0.0022,0.0087,-0.0772,0,0.062,-0.1374,0.0297,0.0934,0.0947,-0.1634,0.0004,-0.1874,-0.0993,0.0227,-0.0485,0.1297,-0.0789,0.1021,0.1753,-0.0896,-0.1281,-0.0258,-0.0696,0.0092,0.0402,0.0986,-0.052,-0.0741,0.0557,0.1619,0.0552,-0.0324,-0.1063,0.0565,-0.0857,-0.0694,-0.1454,-0.0563,-0.1103,0.0879,-0.0433,-0.0846,-0.0407,-0.046,-0.1148,-0.1032,-0.066,0.0652,-0.0284,-0.0058,0.0753,0.0044,-0.0468,0.186,-0.0231,-0.0267,0.0585,-0.0695,-0.0735,-0.0307,0.0438,0.0214,0.0402,0.0528,-0.0767,-0.0703,-0.0228,0.1174,0.0304,0.0603,-0.0602,-0.0686,0.1276,-0.1818,-0.1352,0.0372,0.0722,-0.0144,-0.0038,-0.1276,-0.0754,-0.0717,-0.0742,-0.0153,-0.024,-0.0309,-0.1341,0.1423,0.0165,0.0604,0.1121,-0.1037,-0.0818,0.0462,-0.0683,0.0211,-0.012,0.0809,0.042,0,0.0659,-0.0575,-0.0466,0.0448,0.0081,-0.0359,0.0907,0.0527,-0.0763,-0.1183,-0.0466,0.0382,-0.0176,-0.0289,-0.0465,0.0308,0.0027,0.0823,-0.1152,0.1452,0.1123,0.1181,-0.0456,-0.0901,-0.067,0.0932,0.1044,0.0672,-0.0138,0.0806,0.0214,-0.0758,-0.0763,-0.0031,0.0677,0.0017,0.0459,-0.0151,-0.1779,0.1573,0.0152,-0.0012,-0.0488,0.0589,-0.0259,0.1524,0.0505,-0.0094,-0.0679,-0.0414,0.0666,0.0435,-0.0512,-0.197,-0.0133,-0.0631,-0.0343,-0.0332,-0.0128,0.0819,0.0675,-0.0279,-0.0553,0.0367,0.0758,-0.0187,-0.0606,0.0615,-0.0457,-0.0355,-0.0842,-0.0761,-0.0294,-0.0928,0.0503,0.0046,0.0351,0.0448,0.0189,-0.0231,-0.0606,-0.0883,-0.018,-0.0034,0.1217,0.2446,-0.0752,0.0896,0.0334,0.0393,0.1223,0.0275,0.0245,0.0758,-0.0511,0,-0.0935,0.0154,0.0133,0.0184,0.012,0.0113,0.0276,-0.0127,-0.0549,0.1121,0.1081,0.0968,-0.0756,0.0986,0.1002,0.0336,0.008,0.1184,-0.1514,0.0061,0.0228,-0.0191,-0.0831,-0.0573,-0.1114,0.0075,-0.1957,0.0127,0.0504,-0.0564,0.0961,-0.0275,-0.0702,0.1068,-0.16,0.0363,0.0044,0.008,-0.0825,0.0313,-0.1151,-0.1592,0.0293,0.0208,-0.079,0.0716,0.0635,-0.0356,-0.0221,-0.007,-0.1111,-0.0043,0.0006,-0.0686,0.1041,0.0935,0.0835,0.058,0.0246,0.1096,0.0883,-0.0317,-0.2082,0.0036],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdNavigationMap.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

See [UI Design Standards](../codeStandards/codeUIDesignStandards.md#9-accessibility--responsiveness).\n- **Navigation:** Tapping a tile smoothly transitions the player to the selected game mode.\n- **Cancel/Back Out:** Tapping outside the map area or pressing the map icon button again collapses the map. If device orientation changes mid-animation, the expansion is canceled and reverts to the default footer state.\n- **Fallback:** If the map fails to load, a simplified, high-contrast text menu appears instantly.\n- **Responsiveness:** If viewport height <400px or width <640px, hide the map icon entirely. Map and tiles dynamically resize based on screen size and resolution. Animations must maintain 60fps on devices.\n\n---\n\n## Player Flow\n\n1. Player taps map icon in bottom right corner.\n2. Village map expands with slide-up animation (<500ms).\n3. Player browses tiles representing different modes.\n4. Player taps a tile → transitions smoothly to selected mode (**≤300 ms**).\n5. Player taps outside map or map icon → map collapses.\n6. If assets fail → fallback text menu appears instantly.\n7. If device rotates mid-animation → map closes cleanly, footer resets.\n\n---\n\n## Prioritized Functional Requirements\n\n","qaContext":"ene content.","embedding":[-0.0069,0.0175,0.0356,-0.0612,0.0486,0.0085,0.071,-0.0233,0.0085,0.0333,0.1262,-0.0256,0.0273,0.0241,0.0003,0.0379,0.0168,0.0929,-0.0532,0.0035,0.0944,-0.1145,0.0761,-0.0228,-0.0662,0.0949,-0.0357,0.0416,-0.1238,-0.0793,-0.0503,0.1255,0.0389,0.0216,-0.0288,0.0695,-0.0495,0.0039,-0.1033,-0.0114,-0.1046,0.0405,0.0704,0.0382,0.091,-0.0302,-0.0195,-0.0649,-0.0442,0.0757,-0.1686,-0.1082,0.0167,-0.0221,0.0185,-0.0258,-0.0143,0.0436,0.0845,0.0757,0.0491,0.0112,0.0319,0.081,0.0934,-0.0372,0.0096,-0.0353,0.0102,0.0219,0.0342,-0.0802,0.0773,-0.0718,0.002,-0.0177,-0.0869,0.0325,-0.0832,-0.1217,0.0732,-0.1036,-0.0136,-0.0104,-0.0189,-0.0351,0.0099,-0.0739,0.1112,0.0476,-0.0674,0.0233,0.037,0.0264,0.1032,-0.086,-0.0577,-0.1372,-0.0972,0.1058,-0.0144,-0.0827,0.0842,0.0587,0.0155,-0.0824,0.0958,0.0188,-0.1008,0.1632,0.0177,-0.0431,-0.0322,0.0361,-0.1244,0.0193,-0.0162,0.0671,0.062,0.0991,0.0766,-0.0486,-0.0687,-0.1137,0.0359,-0.0178,-0.0291,0,-0.02,-0.1,-0.111,0.037,0.1176,-0.1526,-0.018,-0.1175,-0.1567,0.0481,0.044,0.1295,-0.0781,0.1043,0.1031,-0.1275,-0.0223,0.0909,-0.0725,0.0093,0.0883,0.0193,-0.117,-0.0934,0.0479,0.2136,-0.031,-0.0125,-0.0087,0.0602,-0.1019,-0.0834,-0.0655,-0.1033,0.0432,-0.0031,-0.0541,-0.0458,-0.0697,0.0019,-0.1461,-0.1093,-0.0902,-0.0685,-0.0192,-0.1162,0.0797,0.06,0.0028,0.1233,0.0403,-0.0157,-0.1011,-0.1274,0.036,-0.1258,-0.0235,0.0466,0.0462,0.1506,-0.0431,-0.0778,0.0012,-0.0194,0.0606,0,0.0294,-0.0684,0.0566,-0.172,-0.0488,-0.0477,0.1794,0.0136,-0.0823,-0.0752,-0.122,-0.0178,-0.1369,-0.0471,-0.0875,-0.1056,-0.058,0.0276,-0.0139,-0.0483,0.0926,-0.1073,-0.1645,0.0295,-0.1264,-0.0015,-0.0081,0.0343,0.0099,0,0.0152,0.0081,-0.0773,0.1106,-0.049,-0.0188,0.2209,0.1807,-0.0349,-0.1108,-0.0538,0.0547,-0.0463,-0.0474,-0.0903,0.1107,0.0683,-0.0034,-0.0955,0.1149,0.0811,0.117,-0.0735,0.0364,0.0262,0.1152,0.0896,0.126,-0.0427,0.0115,0.0129,-0.0903,-0.0965,-0.0529,0.0483,-0.0055,0.0381,-0.0355,-0.1642,0.0915,0.1162,0.0065,-0.0611,0.0085,0.0329,0.121,0.1095,0.1015,-0.0883,-0.0508,0.0289,-0.0192,-0.0102,-0.1332,-0.0141,0.042,0.0881,-0.0629,-0.0292,-0.0262,0.1381,-0.1176,-0.0167,0.0242,0.1389,0.0883,-0.0709,0.0179,-0.0237,0.0625,-0.0818,-0.0103,0.0986,-0.106,0.0157,0.0574,0.0763,0.0136,0.0683,-0.143,-0.0851,0.0288,0.0574,0.054,0.0871,0.2185,-0.1402,0.0436,0.0321,0.0821,0.0218,-0.0063,0.0591,0.0679,-0.0579,0,-0.1505,0.0652,-0.0451,-0.0238,0.0088,-0.0112,0.0565,0.0207,0.0271,-0.0479,0.1528,0.0483,-0.0204,0.1016,0.1069,0.0205,-0.0083,0.1546,-0.1658,-0.0365,-0.0244,-0.0298,-0.0323,-0.0061,-0.068,0.0108,-0.2289,-0.013,0.0202,-0.1015,0.0585,0.0039,0.0118,0.0729,-0.1309,-0.0012,0.0761,-0.0116,-0.0291,0.0693,-0.0466,-0.105,-0.0445,-0.0193,-0.0047,0.0475,0.0847,-0.1159,-0.0256,0.0408,-0.0726,-0.0274,-0.0751,-0.0022,0.2038,-0.025,0.081,0.0527,-0.0132,0.1307,0.0494,0.032,-0.1168,-0.0153],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdNavigationMap.md [chunk 2]","tags":["prd","design-doc","how"],"version":1},

Default is OFF.\n- **Full Navigation Map Flag:** Access to the expanded map is controlled via the `fullNavigationMap` feature flag on the Settings page.

She feels transported into a living judo world, exploring new modes with excitement and confidence.\n\n---","qaContext":"TL;DR This PRD defines an immersive, thematic expanded map view for Ju-Do-Kon!","embedding":[0.0413,0.061,0.0401,-0.0591,0.0495,0.0587,0.0799,-0.0974,0.0686,-0.0407,0.1225,-0.1139,0.0698,0.0558,0.0985,-0.04,0.1429,0.1376,0.1037,-0.0026,0.0285,-0.012,0.1636,0.0614,-0.1276,0.0701,0.0521,0.0548,-0.0455,-0.0564,-0.1294,0.2711,-0.0146,0.0527,-0.1808,0.1576,0.0467,0.0137,-0.0404,-0.0123,-0.1692,0.0642,0.122,0.0614,0.3418,0.0173,0.1032,-0.1186,0.0552,-0.04,-0.1804,-0.1582,0.1471,-0.0118,0.1614,0.0431,-0.1484,0.0681,0.1333,0.1586,0.0606,0.1267,-0.0178,0.0817,0.0606,-0.2745,-0.0669,0.2817,0.0797,-0.1275,0.101,-0.1011,0.1448,-0.036,-0.0018,0.0148,-0.0743,0.0213,-0.0371,-0.1085,0.092,-0.0264,0.075,0.0163,-0.1007,-0.0229,0.0551,-0.0996,0.1129,0.0603,-0.0355,0.0199,-0.0884,-0.0463,-0.1073,-0.1091,-0.1344,0.104,-0.0567,0.2205,0.0693,-0.0057,0.1467,-0.0186,-0.0102,-0.1664,0.0808,0.0604,0.0222,0.162,0.0141,-0.1021,-0.0497,-0.0353,-0.1065,0.1529,-0.094,0.0511,-0.0462,0.1869,0.0208,-0.2179,0.0916,-0.0901,-0.0079,0.0345,-0.1583,0,0.1106,-0.1775,0.074,0.0759,0.0823,-0.2356,0.0243,-0.3164,-0.1203,0.0259,-0.0479,0.1332,-0.1125,0.1351,0.134,-0.0905,-0.2031,-0.0672,-0.065,0.0349,0.0942,0.0942,-0.1701,-0.0643,0.0648,0.1795,0.0949,-0.0077,-0.1056,0.1375,-0.0713,-0.0908,-0.1566,-0.1161,-0.1155,0.1328,0.0011,-0.1139,-0.0596,-0.0155,-0.0936,-0.1857,-0.148,0.0912,-0.0282,0.0663,0.0608,-0.0235,-0.0109,0.1937,-0.1569,-0.1358,0.0999,0.0001,-0.0016,0.0266,0.0283,0.0547,0.0853,0.0307,-0.1812,-0.157,-0.2035,0.1582,-0.0006,-0.1023,-0.0476,-0.0394,0.1519,-0.2268,-0.183,0.038,-0.0016,-0.0106,-0.0894,-0.1676,-0.1553,-0.0178,-0.0838,0.1041,0.0146,0.0432,-0.1064,0.2375,0.1492,0.1691,0.1028,-0.1543,-0.1401,0.0806,-0.029,0.0323,0.0214,0.0225,0.0123,0,0.0818,0.0267,-0.0229,0.091,0.0638,-0.0518,0.1641,0.1825,-0.1273,-0.0925,-0.0317,-0.1048,0.0106,-0.0008,-0.0329,0.0075,0.0195,0.0862,-0.1422,0.1691,0.148,0.0086,0.0504,-0.1121,-0.1432,0.157,0.1052,0.0784,-0.0748,0.146,-0.0391,-0.26,-0.0216,0.1007,0.1262,0.0052,0.0714,-0.0417,-0.192,0.1175,0.0123,-0.0274,-0.1385,0.1388,-0.0393,0.1564,-0.0594,0.041,-0.087,-0.1662,0.0318,0.0546,-0.0763,-0.3094,-0.0029,-0.0774,0.054,0.0611,-0.0693,0.1397,0.0235,-0.1702,-0.0653,0.1327,0.0384,0.0475,-0.0308,0.1384,-0.1371,-0.1167,-0.0779,-0.1122,-0.0165,-0.081,0.025,-0.0733,0.0158,0.1153,0.0298,-0.0074,0.0227,-0.0854,-0.0481,0.0287,0.2462,0.3825,-0.0826,0.1007,0.0546,0.0247,0.1616,0.1263,-0.0523,0.0248,-0.1182,0,-0.2127,-0.0133,0.0444,-0.0569,-0.0617,0.0818,0.0794,-0.0365,-0.0895,0.1219,0.0995,0.1354,-0.1639,0.1103,0.177,-0.0498,-0.0124,0.1551,-0.1271,0.0049,0.0723,-0.0997,0.0702,-0.051,-0.0975,-0.0057,-0.3335,0.0771,0.0773,-0.1326,0.0562,0.0012,-0.1303,0.1998,-0.3134,-0.0044,-0.0572,-0.0802,-0.1246,-0.0004,-0.1878,-0.3298,0.0611,0.0285,-0.0682,0.1599,0.2328,-0.0689,0.0203,-0.1255,-0.1398,-0.0735,0.0723,-0.0293,0.0866,0.1542,0.0834,-0.0354,-0.0461,0.1718,0.0195,-0.1141,-0.2954,-0.0422],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdNavigationMap.md [chunk 7]","tags":["prd","design-doc","what"],"version":1},
{"id":"prdNavigationMap.md-chunk-8","text":"## Problem Statement\n\nPlayers have reported that the current navigation menus feel disconnected from the Ju-Do-Kon! theme, which weakens immersion and reduces excitement when switching game modes. A theoretical 10-year-old playtester noted:\n\n> \"The menu feels boring compared to the rest of the game — can it look more exciting? Maybe like a judo dojo or village?\"\n\nCurrently, the menu is purely functional but lacks the thematic cohesion that draws players deeper into the Ju-Do-Kon! world. Additionally, important new modes are hard to find because the plain menu structure buries them below a list format, making discovery harder for players.

{"id":"prdNavigationMap.md-chunk-12","text":"## Player Actions\n\n- **Trigger:** In landscape mode, tapping the bottom right corner map icon expands a \"Judo Training Village\" map from the footer with a smooth upward slide animation (<500ms).\n- **Map Layout:** The map presents different game modes as a grid of image tiles representing village landmarks (Dojo (training hall), Budokan (martial arts arena), Kodokan (judo headquarters)), with minimum 44px touch target size. See [UI Design Standards](../codeStandards/codeUIDesignStandards.md#9-accessibility--responsiveness).\n- **Navigation:** Tapping a tile smoothly transitions the player to the selected game mode.\n- **Cancel/Back Out:** Tapping outside the map area or pressing the map icon button again collapses the map.

{"id":"prdNavigationBar.md-chunk-1","text":"# PRD: Navigation Bar\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThis PRD defines a persistent, responsive bottom navigation bar for Ju-Do-Kon! to provide clear, consistent navigation across all screens. It improves player flow, reduces confusion, and increases session duration by offering quick access to core game modes (**navigation visible within 100 ms**) with accessible, high-performance interactions.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nPlayers currently experience confusion and increased cognitive load when navigating between game screens due to the lack of a consistent, always-visible navigation system. This leads to flow disruption, frustration, and early session exits.\n\n---\n\n## Description\n\nThe **JU-DO-KON!** game features multiple game modes and screens. Players need easy, intuitive navigation to seamlessly transition between activities such as battles, judoka browsing, and training. When navigation is unclear, players experience increased cognitive load and frustration, breaking immersion and potentially leading to session drop-offs.\n\n> After an intense battle, Kenta sees the familiar JU-DO-KON! logo in the bottom-left corner. He taps it, revealing a smooth, scrolling list of game modes (**scroll ≥60 fps**, expand <500 ms). In a couple of seconds, he’s exploring his Judoka roster without friction — he feels confident, immersed, and eager to keep playing.\n\n### Example Scenario\n\n> Player finishes battle → confusion navigating back → flow disruption → early session exit.\n\n---\n\n## User Stories\n\n- As a new player, I want an always-visible navigation bar so I don’t get lost between screens.\n- As a mobile user, I want touch-friendly buttons so I can navigate confidently with my thumb.\n- As a player who uses screen readers, I want navigation elements to be labeled properly so I can move around the game without barriers.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n- Reduce navigation-related exits by **20%**.\n- Increase average session duration per player by **15%**.\n- Ensure **44px minimum** touch target size (see [UI Design","qaContext":"PRD: Navigation Bar --- ## TL;DR This PRD defines a persistent, responsive bottom navigation bar for Ju-Do-Kon!","embedding":[-0.0037,0.0667,0.0304,-0.1175,0.0431,0.0472,0.1623,0.0924,0.026,0.0687,-0.0011,-0.0558,0.1001,0.0243,0.056,-0.0111,0.0671,0.1391,-0.049,0.092,0.0783,-0.0905,0.048,-0.0386,-0.2111,0.0364,-0.043,-0.0487,-0.1155,-0.1051,-0.0157,0.1417,-0.0069,-0.0223,-0.1371,-0.1034,-0.043,0.0276,-0.1423,-0.0938,-0.1455,0.056,0.0183,0.1007,0.0297,-0.0141,-0.0654,-0.0634,0.0133,0.0543,-0.11,-0.0976,0.1029,-0.0493,0.0754,0.1023,-0.049,0.0517,0.0098,0.1358,0.0357,-0.021,-0.0063,0.0356,0.0773,-0.0484,0.0773,0.0066,0.0062,0.0903,-0.0538,-0.0056,0.0491,-0.0575,0.0909,-0.0656,-0.042,0.0006,-0.0452,-0.0911,0.009,0.0542,-0.1138,-0.013,0.0038,-0.1111,0.0262,-0.0224,0.0575,0.0275,-0.0852,0.0659,0.0077,-0.0713,0.0224,-0.012,-0.0501,-0.0427,-0.0585,0.0927,0.0854,0.0821,0.107,0.0818,-0.0366,-0.0503,0.0814,0.0548,-0.1357,0.1414,0.0024,-0.0209,-0.1334,-0.0441,-0.033,0.1002,-0.0435,0.0408,0.1744,0.0816,0.0513,-0.0509,-0.0521,-0.0046,0.1115,0.0027,-0.051,0,0.0005,-0.1105,-0.0795,0.0223,0.0573,-0.0352,0.0071,-0.0874,-0.0526,0.0462,-0.0526,0.1017,-0.0754,0.0748,0.128,-0.1158,-0.1056,0.0066,-0.113,-0.0263,0.142,-0.041,0.0029,-0.0374,0.0962,0.1624,0.0038,-0.0232,-0.0128,0.0464,-0.113,-0.0647,-0.0969,-0.0677,-0.0329,0.0102,-0.0197,-0.0603,0.0602,-0.006,-0.1562,-0.0484,-0.0081,0.0122,-0.1713,-0.1227,0.0291,0.0092,-0.0429,0.0663,-0.0895,-0.0319,0.0109,-0.1707,-0.0604,-0.1217,0.0033,0.0726,-0.0449,0.0776,0.0177,-0.0611,-0.0535,0.0939,-0.0171,0.0776,-0.0478,0.0454,0.0676,-0.2131,-0.106,0.0349,0.1704,-0.0386,0.044,-0.0879,-0.0144,0.0099,-0.1095,-0.0311,0.0279,-0.0256,-0.119,0.0774,0.0061,-0.1004,0.0482,-0.1394,-0.2168,0.0648,-0.1151,-0.031,0.04,0.0711,-0.0846,0,0.0255,-0.0127,0.0135,0.0362,0.0317,-0.0202,0.144,0.1144,-0.0636,-0.2066,-0.0817,0.111,-0.0765,-0.0271,-0.0493,0.0994,0.0524,0.0121,-0.0727,0.0687,0.1146,0.1108,-0.1072,-0.0543,0.0518,-0.0224,0.1563,0.0355,-0.0189,0.0142,0.0402,-0.0073,-0.0377,-0.0229,0.0253,-0.0314,0.0001,-0.0072,-0.1504,0.1304,0.1192,0.0524,0.0433,-0.0172,0.0789,0.1991,-0.0225,-0.0082,-0.1278,0.0481,0.0499,-0.0337,-0.0829,-0.2592,-0.0275,-0.0316,-0.0779,-0.0043,-0.0006,-0.0392,0.148,-0.0461,-0.1266,-0.0094,0.0781,0.0911,-0.0469,0.0414,-0.0375,0.0164,-0.0987,-0.039,0.0087,-0.1032,0.0502,0.0685,0.0419,0.0314,0.046,-0.005,-0.0577,-0.0205,0.0194,-0.0502,0.0586,0.2218,-0.1608,0.0875,0.0332,0.0175,0.0246,0.0439,0.0583,0.0879,-0.0119,0,-0.0241,0.0116,-0.0113,-0.0053,0.0111,0.0613,-0.0123,-0.0601,-0.075,-0.0324,0.1828,0.0486,-0.0171,0.0677,0.0828,0.0961,-0.007,0.1044,-0.1369,0.0532,-0.0176,-0.015,-0.0521,0.0525,-0.0338,0.055,-0.1706,0.0142,0.0482,-0.1565,0.1007,0.0165,-0.0397,0.0148,-0.0176,0.0774,0.0045,0.0418,0.0411,0.1257,-0.1045,-0.1282,-0.0202,0.0426,-0.0219,0.0311,-0.0212,-0.042,-0.0383,-0.0858,-0.0294,-0.0038,-0.0143,-0.0092,0.1457,0.0704,0.0664,0.0122,0.021,0.0592,0.0456,0.0664,-0.2004,0.0782],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdNavigationBar.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

Each item references an entry in `gameModes.json` via its `id` so mode names and descriptions remain consistent.\n\n### Standard Mode (Default View)\n\n- Navigation links are laid out in a horizontal row.\n- A bottom-left corner **ju-do-kon!** logo acts as an interactive button.\n- Tapping the logo reveals a vertically unrolled text menu listing the available game modes (functions in both landscape and portrait orientation).\n- Links and labels scale responsively with screen size.\n\n### Portrait Mode\n\n- In portrait orientation, the navigation collapses into just the logo.\n- Tapping the logo reveals a vertically unrolled text menu listing the available game modes (functions in both landscape and portrait orientation).\n\n### Flow\n\n- After any activity, the persistent nav bar is visible.\n- In portrait view only the logo shows; tapping it expands the text list.\n- Player selects a mode and is taken to that screen.\n- If `navigationItems.json` fails, load the fallback list and auto-reload.\n\n### Technical Considerations\n\n- Load active game modes dynamically from `navigationItems.json`, fallback to default on failure.\n- Cache loaded mode list to avoid redundant fetches across sessions.\n- Use hardware-accelerated CSS transforms for nav animations (e.g., `translate3d`).\n- Optimize for devices as small as 320px width (typical of older low-end Android devices).\n- Listen for device orientation events to trigger smooth re-layout without stutter (**re-layout <500 ms**).\n\n### Dependencies / Integrations\n\n- `gameModes.json` defines the available modes.\n- `navigationItems.json` references those modes by `id` and controls navigation order and visibility.\n- CSS variables `--color-secondary` and `--button-text-color` for styling.\n- Existing footer layout modules.\n\n---","qaContext":"How It Works The bottom navigation bar appears consistently across all game screens, dynamically loading active game modes from `navigationItems.","embedding":[-0.0909,0.082,0.0193,-0.0948,0.0907,-0.0316,-0.0275,0.1077,-0.0635,0.0536,0.0205,0.1033,0.0747,-0.0527,0.0712,-0.0243,-0.0354,0.0836,0.026,0.0479,0.1087,-0.1019,0.0538,-0.1128,-0.0906,0.0556,0.0238,0.0399,-0.0935,-0.1445,0.038,0.2047,-0.0013,-0.0107,-0.1369,-0.1929,0.0184,-0.1118,-0.1665,-0.0889,-0.0674,0.0343,-0.015,0.0471,0.0031,-0.0104,-0.1141,-0.0066,-0.0176,0.1223,-0.0673,-0.1328,0.0445,-0.034,0.026,0.1338,-0.0211,0.0517,0.0698,0.1172,0.1837,0.0255,-0.0517,0.0663,0.0902,-0.0512,0.0576,-0.0574,-0.0742,0.02,0.023,-0.0908,0.0643,-0.103,-0.0073,-0.1366,-0.0598,0.0392,-0.0991,-0.1621,-0.0058,0.054,-0.0453,0.1085,0.0545,-0.0777,-0.0431,0.0374,0.0337,0.0553,-0.076,-0.0111,0.0075,-0.0976,0.0068,-0.0215,-0.1146,-0.1208,-0.0795,0.092,-0.0149,0.0403,0.1822,0.1175,-0.0336,0.0069,0.0726,0.0542,-0.1407,0.1759,0.0374,0.0902,-0.0953,-0.0367,-0.0312,-0.026,0.0316,0.0485,0.1333,0.0673,0.0806,0.0274,-0.0028,-0.105,0.0977,0.0814,-0.0279,0,0.0335,-0.0627,-0.0364,0.095,0.0769,0.0123,0.04,0.0018,-0.1203,0.0449,-0.0075,0.1966,-0.1059,0.1397,0.1027,-0.1323,0.0254,0.0011,-0.0407,-0.0217,0.1048,-0.0392,-0.0117,-0.0485,0.1115,0.2147,0.0002,0.0965,-0.1333,0.0323,-0.0466,-0.1291,-0.0583,-0.0195,-0.0041,-0.0163,-0.1073,-0.0479,-0.013,-0.022,-0.1055,-0.0659,-0.077,-0.0232,-0.1796,-0.0282,0.0198,-0.0541,0.0806,0.0156,-0.0312,-0.0318,-0.0684,-0.147,0.0085,-0.1503,-0.1106,0.13,-0.0044,0.0735,0.0764,-0.0794,-0.0168,0.0373,0.0563,0.1102,-0.0023,-0.0673,0.0211,-0.1971,-0.0053,0.0224,0.1941,0.0386,-0.0236,-0.0018,-0.1026,-0.0668,-0.1502,0.0373,-0.004,-0.0928,-0.0019,0.0657,0.0125,-0.1665,0.0922,-0.0924,-0.0748,-0.0212,-0.1404,-0.1048,0.0827,-0.0014,-0.0385,0,0.0017,-0.0353,-0.0199,0.0151,-0.1175,-0.0356,0.1139,0.1645,-0.0934,-0.2013,-0.0432,0.176,-0.0418,-0.0548,0.0209,0.1686,-0.0096,-0.0573,-0.0482,0.0385,0.0477,0.0719,-0.0554,0.0266,0.0266,-0.052,0.2366,0.1011,-0.0086,-0.0158,0.1338,0.002,0.0006,0.0044,0.097,-0.0274,-0.0121,0.0188,-0.1531,0.0249,0.1452,0.0321,0.0163,-0.0476,0.0621,0.0802,-0.009,-0.0075,-0.1442,-0.058,0.0499,-0.0408,0.0234,-0.1241,-0.0005,0.0074,-0.0548,0.041,-0.0375,-0.0133,0.1431,-0.1,-0.1002,-0.0623,0.0392,0.0081,-0.0403,-0.0162,-0.0645,0.0505,-0.1234,-0.0896,0.1025,-0.0269,-0.0532,0.0167,0.1977,-0.0391,0.0212,-0.0889,-0.0357,-0.054,0.0188,-0.092,0.024,0.0939,-0.1253,0.08,0.0726,0.0427,-0.0269,0.0225,0.0376,0.1046,-0.0331,0,-0.0333,-0.0417,-0.0231,-0.0056,-0.0057,0.0633,0.1306,-0.0294,-0.0218,-0.0504,0.0462,0.0589,-0.0697,0.0348,0.09,0.1401,0.0406,0.1674,-0.1029,0.0057,-0.0473,0.0039,-0.0002,0.0204,-0.0078,0.0374,-0.1595,-0.0142,0.0692,-0.0922,0.0441,0.0819,0.0594,-0.0239,-0.0889,0.0371,0.0197,0.0602,0.119,-0.0601,0.0142,-0.0854,-0.0851,-0.0278,-0.0322,0.0213,0.0129,0.0718,0.0054,0.0031,-0.0996,0.0818,-0.0439,-0.0322,0.0853,0.038,0.0575,0.0008,0.1355,-0.0463,0.0685,0.0054,-0.135,-0.0138],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdNavigationBar.md [chunk 13]","tags":["prd","design-doc","how"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdMysteryCard.md-chunk-1","text":"# PRD: Mystery Judoka Card (JU-DO-KON!)\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThe **Mystery Judoka Card** is a placeholder card used in _every round against the opponent_. It temporarily hides the opponent’s real card until the player selects a stat, ensuring fair gameplay and preventing stat-based cheating. The card uses a silhouette portrait, obscured stats (`\"?\"`), and the name “Mystery Judoka”, providing a consistent and thematic experience during the stat selection phase.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nCurrently, the opponent’s card is visible before the player chooses a stat. This unintentionally encourages players to base their choice on the opponent’s values — compromising fairness and removing tension from the match. The **Mystery Judoka Card** acts as a stat-obscuring placeholder that maintains surprise and integrity in each round.\n\n> Sota faces off against an opponent. A card appears with a dark silhouette and mysterious stats. He hovers between Power and Kumi-kata. With a deep breath, he picks Power. The card flips — revealing the opponent: a legendary -100kg champion with immense strength. Too late to change. That moment of tension? That’s the thrill we’re aiming for.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n- Prevent pre-selection peeking at the opponent’s stats to maintain competitive fairness.\n- Introduce momentary suspense in each round to heighten emotional investment.\n- Preserve visual consistency using an existing card (`judokaId=1`) with special styling.\n- Ensure the opponent card reveal animation completes within **400ms**.\n- Guarantee **100% concealment** of all opponent stats during player stat selection.\n  - **Note:** The signature move does not need to be obscured and should be displayed as \"?\" on the Mystery Judoka card.\n\n---\n\n## User Stories\n\n- As a player, I want to choose my stat _before_ seeing the opponent’s card, so the match feels fair and unpredictable.\n- As a returning player, I want the placeholder card to feel familiar and thematic, not jarring.\n- As a developer, I want to reus","qaContext":"PRD: Mystery Judoka Card (JU-DO-KON!","embedding":[-0.096,0.1655,-0.0483,0.0817,-0.0487,0.1035,0.1379,0.0493,0.1958,-0.0161,-0.0053,-0.1826,0.0425,0.0341,0.0776,0.0052,0.1217,0.164,-0.0948,0.1426,0.0937,-0.1168,0.0451,-0.0421,-0.0072,0.0149,0.0143,-0.0544,-0.0557,-0.1481,-0.0524,0.1505,0.1333,-0.0638,-0.0781,-0.0213,-0.0787,0.1267,-0.0557,-0.0297,-0.1184,0.0362,0.0252,0.0931,0.0834,0.0135,0.004,0.0481,-0.0415,-0.0703,-0.158,-0.0711,-0.0507,0.0499,0.1426,-0.0142,0.0509,-0.1127,-0.0213,0.0123,0.0237,-0.0279,0.0099,0.0697,0.01,-0.0886,0.0336,0.0639,0.0312,0.1656,0.0151,0.0484,-0.0881,-0.0039,0.0508,0.1549,-0.0913,-0.0526,0.0307,-0.0348,0.0729,-0.0109,0.0313,0.016,0.1039,-0.0675,0.0772,-0.0215,0.132,-0.0114,0.0535,0.0776,0.0366,-0.0149,0.0844,0.0182,-0.0794,0.0259,-0.0177,0.1295,-0.009,-0.0342,-0.0083,0.0142,0.096,-0.0363,-0.013,-0.0373,0.0449,0.0094,0.0022,-0.0784,-0.1428,0.056,-0.0037,0.2176,-0.0082,0.0709,-0.0301,0.0987,0.1263,-0.0476,-0.0203,0.0286,0.0475,0.0106,-0.0822,0,0.0833,-0.0553,-0.063,0.0012,-0.0712,-0.1138,-0.028,-0.171,-0.0479,0.146,-0.0225,0.126,-0.0369,0.1002,0.0559,-0.024,-0.1878,0.0316,0.01,-0.0019,0.1843,0.0613,-0.0488,-0.1339,-0.0392,0.1344,0.0369,-0.1317,-0.0492,0.0271,-0.0074,-0.1563,-0.0316,0.0241,-0.1005,-0.0148,0.0016,-0.1029,-0.022,0.0761,-0.1802,0.0146,-0.132,-0.1117,0.0973,-0.144,-0.0048,0.0349,-0.0549,0.1205,-0.0465,0.0393,0.1146,-0.0548,-0.1036,-0.0165,0.0871,0.0219,-0.0629,0.0745,-0.09,-0.0979,-0.1679,0.0403,-0.0583,0.0837,-0.0772,-0.0608,0.0345,-0.1024,-0.0833,0.081,-0.059,-0.0436,-0.0822,-0.1324,0.0218,0.1131,-0.1687,-0.061,-0.0267,0.0397,-0.1979,0.0329,-0.0943,0.072,0.1423,-0.0762,-0.2132,0.1114,0.0597,0.0409,0.0103,0.09,-0.0047,0,-0.0376,-0.0459,-0.0352,0.1238,0.109,-0.0352,0.0396,0.0472,-0.0003,-0.2071,-0.0569,0.001,-0.0763,-0.0363,0.0006,-0.0457,-0.0493,0.052,-0.1785,0.1202,0.1102,0.1286,-0.0666,-0.0758,-0.0707,0.0943,0.0836,-0.0457,-0.008,0.0385,-0.1179,-0.1047,-0.1235,-0.0145,-0.015,-0.0394,-0.0367,-0.0071,-0.0341,0.2432,0.0261,0.0441,-0.0396,0.0559,-0.0366,0.0616,0.0154,-0.0137,0.1244,-0.1283,0.0495,-0.0227,-0.1077,-0.0013,-0.1651,0.0049,0.0094,-0.0676,-0.0248,0.1487,0.0141,-0.024,0.0243,-0.0448,0.0648,0.1093,-0.0659,0.0081,-0.0253,-0.0575,-0.0545,-0.0084,-0.0677,-0.0358,0.111,0.061,-0.0776,0.0238,0.08,-0.0221,-0.1207,-0.0236,-0.0172,-0.0681,0.1122,0.212,-0.0871,0.0452,0.0831,-0.033,-0.0384,0.0853,0.1589,0.03,-0.0144,0,-0.0987,-0.0489,0.0552,0.0859,0.0113,0.0619,-0.0006,-0.1984,-0.0915,-0.0274,0.2411,0.1524,-0.0692,-0.0674,0.04,-0.0824,-0.0659,0.1102,-0.1226,-0.0393,0.0112,-0.0701,-0.0568,-0.1282,-0.1102,-0.001,-0.0808,0.033,0.0882,0.0287,0.0737,-0.057,0.0492,0.0922,-0.0315,0.0859,-0.035,0.0083,0.0391,0.1215,-0.0528,-0.142,-0.0326,0.0046,0.0452,-0.0243,0.022,-0.1669,-0.0043,-0.021,0.0206,-0.2118,-0.0716,0.0345,0.1065,0.1029,0.0987,0.024,-0.065,0.0309,0.1025,0.0235,-0.1088,0.0503],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdMysteryCard.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdMockupViewer.md-chunk-1","text":"# Mockup Viewer PRD\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThe Mockup Viewer provides a simple, accessible interface for browsing JU-DO-KON! design mockup images. It allows team members and stakeholders to preview all UI mockups in a carousel format, supporting mouse and keyboard navigation. The tool ensures visual consistency and improves design review workflows by centralizing access to UI mockups.\n\n## Problem Statement / Why It Matters\n\nDesigners and developers previously relied on scattered folder structures to find and compare UI mockups. This fragmentation led to wasted time, difficulty in referencing filenames during discussions, and inconsistent visual evaluations. By aggregating mockups into a single interactive viewer, we reduce this friction and improve team velocity, accuracy, and accessibility in design reviews.\n\n## Goals / Success Metrics\n\n| Goal              | Metric                                                                   |\n| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Load Performance  | 100% of images load within ≤1 second on broadband                        |\n| Filename Clarity  | 100% of displayed images show visible filenames                          |\n| Accessibility     | Full keyboard/mouse navigation with ARIA support on 100% of controls     |\n| UX Responsiveness | Layout remains visually usable across desktop, tablet, and mobile        |\n| Engagement        | 100% of mockups accessible on first visit without scrolling or filtering |\n\n## User Stories\n\n- As a designer, I want to quickly flip through all mockups so that I can review UI consistency.\n- As a developer, I want to see the filename of each mockup so that I can reference it in discussions.\n- As a stakeholder, I want to browse mockups easily without needing special tools or permissions.\n- As a user with accessibility needs, I want to navigate mockups using keyboard controls and screen readers.\n- As a user, I want to be able to exit or close the viewer","qaContext":"Mockup Viewer PRD ## TL;DR The Mockup Viewer provides a simple, accessible interface for browsing JU-DO-KON!","embedding":[-0.1027,-0.0332,-0.0169,-0.0183,0.075,-0.0894,0.0347,0.0554,-0.021,0.0455,-0.0495,-0.0481,0.0655,-0.0585,-0.0723,-0.1122,0.1083,0.0136,-0.0182,0.0855,-0.0251,-0.1076,0.0626,-0.082,0.0075,-0.0092,-0.0988,-0.0967,-0.1215,-0.0806,0.0125,0.0805,-0.1232,-0.0704,0.0504,-0.0581,0.0396,-0.0041,-0.0476,-0.1261,-0.161,0.0614,-0.0141,0.0355,0.0304,-0.1345,-0.0166,-0.1428,0.0205,0.151,-0.2131,-0.1113,0.0012,-0.0014,0.0372,0.0875,0.0664,-0.1003,0.0099,0.1332,-0.0078,-0.0201,0.0459,0.0054,0.0347,0.0804,0.0645,0.0229,0.0599,-0.1579,-0.0575,-0.0166,0.1396,-0.0231,0.0823,-0.0144,-0.1266,-0.1051,0.0642,-0.2459,0.0168,0.0786,-0.035,0.0523,-0.1131,0.0393,0.0647,0.0132,0.0385,-0.0378,-0.0455,-0.0427,-0.0287,-0.0528,0.1195,-0.0432,0.1215,-0.0763,-0.0271,0.118,-0.0468,0.0531,0.186,-0.0846,-0.055,0.0385,0.1047,-0.1142,-0.0896,0.0132,0.0078,0.0032,-0.1441,-0.0191,0.104,-0.0979,0.0331,-0.0487,0.1503,0.0793,0.1226,0.0595,-0.0321,0.0059,0.1362,-0.0506,0.0114,0,0.0479,-0.0766,0.0319,0.1277,0.1894,-0.1209,0.1292,0.0382,-0.1542,-0.0968,0.1075,0.0959,-0.036,0.0329,-0.0165,-0.0253,-0.1271,0.1324,-0.1551,0.0031,-0.0309,-0.1048,-0.0663,0.0008,0.0534,0.0429,-0.0492,0.0775,0.0017,0.0283,-0.0868,-0.0265,0.0047,-0.0217,-0.0993,-0.0483,-0.0004,-0.0729,0.0391,0.0041,-0.0834,-0.147,-0.0077,0.0255,-0.1158,-0.0086,-0.0534,0.018,0.0223,-0.0499,-0.0162,0.0622,-0.0263,-0.0921,0.0441,-0.1724,-0.0165,0.0098,0.046,0.0819,-0.0297,0.1376,-0.1062,0.0745,-0.1425,0.0119,0.0475,-0.0139,0.047,-0.0686,-0.1851,-0.0064,-0.0028,-0.045,0.0432,-0.0543,-0.0658,0.0624,-0.0056,0.0203,0.0562,0.0171,-0.0833,0.0826,-0.0539,-0.1762,-0.0038,-0.1743,-0.1631,-0.1015,-0.1086,0.086,-0.0285,-0.057,-0.0264,0,0.0579,0.0269,-0.0018,0.0793,-0.019,-0.0046,0.0652,-0.0295,0.0047,-0.1285,-0.0363,0.021,-0.1114,-0.1093,-0.0075,0.1084,0.0402,-0.121,-0.0632,0.0256,0.0616,0.101,-0.0025,-0.0045,-0.0205,0.0472,0.0998,-0.0155,0.0544,-0.0468,0.0702,-0.0008,-0.1006,-0.1082,0.1591,-0.0084,-0.0292,0.0113,-0.0751,0.0871,0.0509,-0.0063,0.1011,0.0007,0.0293,0.0617,-0.0119,0.0068,-0.0351,-0.0324,0.0602,-0.0866,-0.0347,-0.2408,0.0227,-0.0322,0.0254,-0.0145,0.0771,-0.0107,0.1335,-0.0518,-0.1704,0.053,-0.0593,-0.0025,-0.0865,-0.0516,-0.0273,0.0689,0.0152,-0.0709,0.0523,-0.096,0.142,0.1232,0.1339,-0.042,0.0738,0.0119,0.0632,0.0809,0.0815,-0.0705,-0.0076,0.1374,-0.1757,0.0945,0.0536,0.0181,-0.065,-0.0303,0.0981,0.0275,0.0385,0,-0.0086,0.0918,0.0726,-0.0442,-0.1063,0.0628,-0.0261,0.0288,-0.012,0.021,0.1915,-0.0826,-0.011,0.0856,0.0371,0.0606,-0.0041,0.1317,-0.1088,-0.0181,0.0045,0.0999,0.0004,-0.033,-0.0422,0.0972,-0.0547,-0.0681,-0.044,-0.0467,0.0807,0.0127,-0.0808,-0.0153,0.0109,0.0053,0.0272,0.0879,0.0498,0.0748,-0.0533,-0.0705,0.0092,-0.0168,-0.0485,-0.0632,-0.0493,-0.0579,-0.0674,-0.0544,-0.1869,-0.1435,0.0357,0.0823,-0.0237,0.0326,0.0962,0.0215,0.0349,0.1037,0.0813,0.1213,-0.0689,0.1544],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdMockupViewer.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdMeditationScreen.md-chunk-1","text":"# PRD: Meditation Screen (Zen mode)\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThis PRD defines a Meditation Screen (Zen mode) for Ju-Do-Kon! to provide a moment of calm between intense battles. By combining a wise quote with the soothing presence of helper character KG, players are encouraged to pause, reflect, and regain balance, improving pacing, focus, and long-term engagement.\n\n---\n\n## Description\n\nIntroduce a **meditation screen** (`meditation.html`) that players can access as a moment of calm between battles. The helper character **KG** appears alongside a random wise quote (an excerpt from Aesop’s Fables), helping players reset their mindset and reflect. Inspired by real-life judo practice—where athletes take time to breathe and refocus—this moment of stillness encourages resilience and clarity.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nCurrently, there’s no structured moment for players to mentally reset between intense card battles. Without a calming intermission, the game may feel relentless or emotionally taxing. The meditation screen provides intentional space to pause, reflect, and regain balance. This emotional pacing enhances player experience and keeps engagement healthy and sustainable.\n\n---\n\n## Impact if Not Solved\n\nPlayers may experience cognitive fatigue or emotional burnout from back-to-back matches, leading to reduced enjoyment and decreased long-term retention.\n\n---\n\n## Behavioral Insight\n\nPlayers benefit from rhythm and pacing. Periods of calm after periods of intensity improve focus and enjoyment. Adding a reflective break strengthens overall game flow and user wellbeing.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n- Allow players to access this screen optionally by the main menu or main navigation bar.\n- Maintain load time under 1 second.\n- Ensure error-free quote display across landscape and portrait orientations.\n- Give players a mindful moment to reset between matches.\n- Offer an experience that aligns with judo’s real-world ethos of reflection.\n\n---\n## Non-Goals\n\n- No guided meditation instruction, brea","qaContext":"PRD: Meditation Screen (Zen mode) --- ## TL;DR This PRD defines a Meditation Screen (Zen mode) for Ju-Do-Kon!","embedding":[-0.0668,0.1304,0.0567,0.0268,0.022,0.1158,0.1791,-0.0251,0.1524,-0.0608,0.0212,-0.0151,0.0008,-0.0441,0.0471,0.0193,0.0747,0.1206,-0.1213,0.1363,0.0696,-0.0567,0.0374,0.1054,-0.1178,0.0869,-0.0879,-0.0443,-0.0099,-0.0502,0.0007,0.1491,0.0596,-0.0332,-0.1292,0.1247,-0.0357,0.1129,-0.1106,-0.1547,-0.1132,-0.0619,-0.0321,0.0621,0.0823,-0.0383,-0.0361,-0.1071,0.0228,-0.1266,-0.1968,-0.0501,-0.005,0.0147,0.1071,0.0982,0.0834,0.1487,-0.0469,0.1302,-0.0284,0.0344,-0.0581,0.0687,-0.0074,0.0307,0.0473,0.0766,-0.0217,0.0777,-0.0775,-0.0723,0.0379,-0.1176,-0.0004,0.086,-0.0325,-0.2097,-0.0117,0.0109,0.0365,0.0848,-0.0093,-0.0035,0.0155,-0.0776,0.1567,-0.0185,0.1606,0.0641,0.037,0.0888,-0.0967,0.0368,0.074,0.0692,-0.1163,0.0704,-0.0993,0.084,0.1242,0.1044,0.0159,-0.0184,-0.0808,-0.0645,0.011,-0.0512,-0.077,0.0556,-0.1043,-0.0263,-0.1063,0.0298,0.0461,0.149,-0.1017,-0.0131,0.1483,0.0537,0.2194,-0.085,0.0708,-0.0349,0.1211,0.0059,-0.0051,0,0.0734,-0.1,-0.011,0.0977,-0.0389,-0.0577,-0.1042,-0.1345,-0.0037,0.0526,0.0182,0.0516,0.0701,0.0355,-0.0169,-0.1407,-0.2137,0.082,0.0525,-0.0365,0.078,-0.0627,-0.089,-0.0589,-0.0409,0.1065,0.1015,-0.0194,-0.085,0.0482,-0.0745,-0.0832,-0.1178,-0.1141,-0.0984,-0.0062,0.035,-0.0083,-0.0217,0.0095,-0.1744,0.1105,-0.008,0.0215,0.0646,-0.0948,-0.0617,-0.0596,-0.0597,0.1176,-0.1278,0.0201,0.1189,-0.1584,-0.1259,-0.1066,0.0862,0.0186,-0.182,-0.0357,-0.0468,-0.1389,-0.1181,0.0596,0.0204,0.0741,-0.2123,-0.0707,-0.0706,-0.0874,-0.1764,0.0389,0.1678,-0.0553,-0.0583,-0.1977,-0.0461,0.1076,-0.1469,-0.012,0.0459,0.0073,-0.1742,0.1369,-0.0102,-0.093,0.0105,-0.052,-0.2302,0.0374,-0.0188,0.064,0.149,0.0398,-0.1391,0,0.0729,-0.0376,-0.0388,0.0855,0.1695,0.057,0.0554,0.1043,0.0269,-0.0966,-0.0345,-0.0444,-0.0243,0.0355,-0.0916,-0.0478,-0.0226,0.0305,-0.1736,0.1949,0.1778,0.0867,0.0203,-0.0903,0.052,0.0575,0.1079,0.0889,0.0029,0.0053,0.1192,-0.0592,-0.1542,0.0611,0.0043,0.0616,-0.0092,-0.0765,-0.2235,0.1312,0.1588,0.1123,-0.0248,0.0482,0.0412,0.1007,0.0061,-0.1609,-0.1819,-0.0405,0.1219,-0.061,-0.0975,-0.1104,0.0906,-0.1261,-0.0095,-0.0624,-0.1067,-0.0171,0.045,0.0616,-0.0628,-0.0299,0.056,0.0764,-0.0252,0.0885,-0.0258,0.0447,-0.0037,0.0914,-0.0824,-0.0387,0.0681,0.1056,-0.0428,-0.1249,-0.0519,-0.049,-0.0499,-0.0545,0.002,-0.0124,-0.0059,0.184,-0.1528,0.1473,0.0318,-0.0276,-0.0278,0.0698,0.0032,0.1148,0.0141,0,-0.0866,-0.1434,0.0008,0.0813,-0.0241,-0.042,0.1,-0.1734,-0.1708,0.0632,0.2178,0.016,0.068,0.0753,0.0563,-0.0005,0.0277,0.082,-0.131,0.0009,0.0564,-0.0776,-0.0623,-0.1151,-0.011,0.0224,-0.0936,0.0894,-0.0155,-0.0919,0.1673,-0.0277,-0.0051,0.0287,-0.0253,0.0339,0.0397,-0.034,0.0559,0.1942,-0.1465,-0.0398,0.0109,0.0835,0.0611,-0.13,-0.0365,-0.0714,0.0005,-0.0371,0.0889,-0.0479,0.0286,0.0222,0.07,0.1295,0.0662,0.0646,0.024,0.0287,0.1531,0.0882,-0.2306,-0.0227],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdMeditationScreen.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

Reflect.”).\n- [x] **2.0 Implement Quote Display Module**\n  - [x] 2.1 Randomly select a quote from `aesopsFables.json` and merge metadata from `aesopsMeta.json`.\n  - [x] 2.2 Display the quote with dynamic, responsive text scaling.\n  - [x] 2.3 Implement skeleton loader while fetching quote using the existing loading spinner styled with `var(--button-bg)`.\n  - [x] 2.4 Fallback to default calm message if quote dat","qaContext":"3.","embedding":[-0.1248,0.0117,-0.0449,-0.0123,0.0041,0.0269,0.0877,0.0356,0.0145,0.0284,0.028,-0.0199,0.0039,-0.0335,0.0856,0.0417,-0.0044,0.0042,-0.0416,0.0142,0.0558,-0.0113,0.0716,0.0566,-0.0688,0.0447,-0.0461,0.029,-0.0418,-0.0503,0.0227,0.0573,0.0631,-0.0412,-0.0259,0.1156,-0.0388,-0.122,-0.0783,-0.1355,-0.0942,0.0347,-0.0613,0.0338,0.0075,-0.0743,-0.1543,-0.0433,0.0367,0.0917,-0.0998,-0.1196,0.1017,-0.0818,-0.0314,0.11,0.0156,0.0568,0.015,0.0515,0.0329,-0.0158,-0.0085,0.0713,0.0369,0.0537,-0.0093,-0.1006,-0.0187,-0.0298,-0.1133,-0.0536,0.0027,0.0009,-0.0739,-0.0863,-0.0398,-0.0529,-0.0758,-0.031,0.0095,-0.0576,-0.0499,0.0605,0.0224,0.0013,0.0389,-0.0354,0.0407,-0.0078,-0.0455,-0.0672,0.0071,0.0373,0.0227,0.0789,-0.0457,-0.0145,-0.0802,0.056,0.0243,0.0171,-0.0381,0.0463,0.0082,-0.0223,0.0263,-0.0449,-0.0654,-0.0047,-0.0565,0.0338,-0.0526,-0.0818,-0.0157,0.001,0.0091,-0.0675,0.1039,0.0994,0.1719,-0.0228,-0.085,0.0084,0.1384,-0.0325,0.0635,0,0.0274,-0.0423,-0.0196,0.0254,0.0691,0.0174,-0.0204,0.0138,-0.1292,-0.0024,-0.0044,-0.0314,-0.0498,-0.0137,0.0278,-0.1371,0.0073,0.0616,0.031,-0.0605,0.0826,-0.0036,-0.0078,0.0802,0.0183,0.1884,0.0771,0.0256,-0.0596,0.0269,-0.0795,-0.1266,-0.051,0.0074,-0.0049,-0.0683,-0.0705,-0.0289,0.0188,0.012,-0.1247,0.0025,0.0088,-0.0683,-0.1387,-0.0175,0.0071,-0.0599,0.0728,0.0067,-0.0761,0.0248,0.016,-0.0516,0.0392,-0.1806,0.015,0.0687,-0.0322,0.0551,-0.0064,-0.0245,0.0209,-0.0214,0.0674,0.0828,-0.0105,-0.0629,0.0286,-0.0686,-0.0794,-0.0155,0.1686,0.0083,0.0093,-0.0574,-0.0785,-0.0453,-0.0127,-0.0368,-0.0698,-0.055,-0.0561,0.0494,0.0898,-0.1129,-0.0063,-0.1396,-0.1048,-0.0581,-0.0119,0.0243,-0.015,-0.0524,-0.0473,0,0.0592,0.1013,-0.0665,0.0532,0.0076,0.0223,0.0464,0.101,0.0337,-0.0592,-0.0959,0.1073,-0.0174,-0.043,0.0065,0.1731,-0.0115,-0.0152,-0.0542,0.0273,0.0432,0.0696,-0.0844,-0.001,0.0406,-0.0047,0.1122,0.0554,0.0605,-0.0011,0.0017,0.078,-0.1162,0.0407,-0.0024,-0.0579,0.012,0.0462,-0.1025,0.0036,0.1756,-0.0071,0.0282,-0.0521,0.0028,0.0104,-0.0502,0.0468,-0.1255,-0.0382,0.0084,-0.0741,-0.0302,-0.0618,-0.0158,-0.0619,-0.0498,-0.0323,0.011,-0.0497,0.0916,-0.0499,0.0233,-0.0915,0.0845,-0.0114,0.0018,0.0178,0.0135,0.0206,-0.0339,0.009,0.0667,0.0095,0.036,0.0491,0.0494,-0.0927,0.0739,0.0055,0.0168,0.0418,0.0784,0.0202,0.0876,0.0789,-0.1557,0.1043,-0.0017,0.0319,-0.0787,0.133,0.1039,0.1078,0.0326,0,-0.0916,-0.0673,-0.0622,-0.008,0.014,-0.0099,0.0312,-0.0044,-0.0391,-0.0317,0.1587,0.0569,0.0238,0.076,-0.0792,0.0614,-0.0391,0.1393,-0.0699,0.0128,0.057,-0.0121,-0.0632,-0.0113,0.018,-0.0105,-0.1179,0.0958,0.0642,-0.0163,0.0654,-0.0255,0.0518,0.0062,-0.0449,-0.0003,-0.0147,0.0184,-0.0026,0.104,-0.0267,0.0082,-0.0792,0.0021,-0.0097,-0.0063,-0.0558,-0.0694,0.0156,-0.0079,-0.0029,-0.053,-0.0721,0.0232,0.0946,0.0457,0.088,0.0396,0.0806,0.0369,0.0624,0.0086,-0.0264,-0.0266],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdMeditationScreen.md [chunk 5]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdJudokaCard.md-chunk-1","text":"# PRD: Judoka Cards (JU-DO-KON!)\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nJudoka cards are interactive virtual cards representing elite fighters in JU-DO-KON! They deepen player immersion through ownership, mastery, and strategic gameplay, with responsive animations, rarity systems, and accessible design — ensuring all players can engage with and feel connected to their judoka roster.\n\nThe main element of the JU-DO-KON! game is the use of **judoka cards**. These virtual cards show elite judoka along with their stats and form the core gameplay piece, giving players a sense of ownership, mastery, and strategic choice.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nPlayers currently lack a tangible sense of progression and connection to elite judoka; without this, engagement drops significantly after initial matches. Judoka cards aim to **provide ownership, mastery, and strategic choice**, addressing the need for deeper attachment to in-game characters.\n\n> Sota clicks \"Draw!\" on his draw pile. The pack shows a card with a slide animation, revealing a rare Judoka in shimmering red borders. Sota’s eyes light up.

Future updates may add a **“Reduce Motion”** option for players sensitive to animations.\n\n---\n\n## The Cards\n\nEach card consists of elements stored in `judoka.json`:\n\n- Judoka Name (first + surname)\n- First and surname appear tightly spaced (line-height about 1) so there is breathing room above and below\n- Nationality (depicted via flag)\n- Weight class (one of the 14 official IJF classes: 7 male, 7 female)\n- Portrait of the judoka’s likeness\n- Stats (Power, Speed, Technique, Kumi-kata _grip fighting_, Ne-waza _ground grappling_) with 0–10 scale\n- Signature Move\n\nThe weight class badge appears in the top-right corner of the portrait with a transparent background and white text for readability.\n\nCards maintain a **2:3 ratio with a border** and display rarity-based coloring:\n\n- **Common**: Blue\n- **Rare**: Red\n- **Legendary**: Gold\n\nThe design must be attractive and **minimize cognitive load**—presenting stats clearly without clutter.\n\n---\n\n## Prioritized Functional Requirements\n\n| Priority | Feature                | Description                                                                  |\n| -------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **P1**   | Core Card Elements     | Judoka name, portrait, stats, nationality flag, signature move.              |\n| **P1**   | Edge Case Handling     | Display silhouette, error messages, or fallbacks for missing/corrupted data. |\n| **P1**   | Real-time Stats Updat","qaContext":"** to ensure visual uniformity and avoid layout shifts.","embedding":[-0.0917,0.184,-0.173,0.0127,-0.036,0.0719,0.0944,0.0612,0.0606,-0.1022,-0.0031,-0.1701,0.0497,0.0993,-0.0448,-0.0092,0.0544,0.1634,-0.1553,0.1214,0.0339,-0.1901,0.0919,-0.0175,-0.1078,0.0837,0.0046,0.0083,-0.1536,-0.115,-0.0958,0.1778,0.1386,0.0338,-0.0834,-0.0209,-0.0764,0.1495,-0.06,-0.0321,-0.1246,0.0043,0.0156,0.1187,0.1064,0.0189,-0.0119,-0.0025,-0.0139,0.0166,-0.1965,0.0062,-0.0209,0.0722,0.1317,-0.0408,0.0352,-0.1271,0.0042,0.0357,-0.0015,0.1039,0.0153,0.0445,-0.1002,-0.1374,-0.0214,0.0251,-0.0147,0.1104,0.0911,-0.0257,-0.089,-0.0989,0.0061,0.0985,-0.0389,-0.0251,0.022,-0.0771,-0.0306,-0.0746,0.0337,-0.0103,0.1186,-0.0016,0.083,-0.0672,-0.0304,-0.0039,0.063,0.0786,0.0364,-0.0182,0.0457,-0.0707,-0.0312,-0.077,-0.1199,0.1645,0.0217,-0.0804,0.1696,0.1611,0.0596,-0.0603,0.057,0.0706,-0.0266,-0.0177,0.0091,0.0064,-0.2037,0.0336,-0.0595,0.1514,-0.0077,0.0248,0.0348,0.0764,0.1025,-0.0583,-0.1153,-0.0428,-0.0067,0.0243,-0.0487,0,-0.0251,-0.0383,-0.0276,0.0478,-0.0622,-0.1232,-0.083,-0.1559,-0.0802,0.0389,-0.0022,0.1798,0.0021,0.1666,0.0463,-0.029,-0.0825,0.0668,-0.0594,0.0633,0.0745,0.0214,-0.0568,-0.1151,-0.0367,0.1856,0.0052,-0.1098,-0.1027,0.0297,-0.0731,-0.1388,-0.0249,-0.09,-0.065,-0.0513,0.0034,-0.1092,0.0048,0.0642,-0.0813,0.0073,-0.131,-0.1169,0.0313,-0.0298,0.1982,0.0986,-0.0354,0.0932,-0.0589,-0.0279,0.0886,-0.0838,-0.0583,-0.0968,0.1371,0.0403,-0.0329,-0.0175,-0.1168,-0.0486,-0.1452,0.0636,0.0544,-0.0029,-0.1172,-0.0101,-0.0287,-0.0249,-0.0514,0.0713,0.0717,0.0111,-0.0376,-0.0313,0.0052,0.0726,-0.1919,0.0178,-0.0937,0.1244,-0.0792,-0.0503,-0.1528,0.0411,0.1473,-0.0317,-0.1824,0.0378,0.0027,0.0525,0.0275,-0.0088,-0.0639,0,-0.0191,-0.0159,0.0158,0.0586,0.1435,0.0044,0.0896,0.1633,0.0171,-0.1532,0.0233,-0.0467,-0.1713,-0.1097,0.0561,0.0014,-0.0867,0.1487,-0.1577,0.0422,0.2224,0.1349,-0.0465,0.0227,-0.1312,0.0308,0.1247,-0.0443,-0.1082,0.0294,-0.0981,-0.2128,-0.0943,0.0995,0.0088,-0.0763,-0.0558,0.0382,-0.0575,0.2665,-0.0401,0.0891,-0.0721,0.075,-0.0092,-0.066,0.0202,0.0312,0.0474,-0.1209,-0.0575,0.0067,-0.05,-0.0048,-0.1322,-0.0079,0.0001,-0.0717,-0.0023,0.0908,-0.0081,-0.0347,-0.035,-0.1459,0.0742,0.0614,-0.0955,-0.0248,-0.0866,-0.0183,-0.1268,-0.0676,0.0093,0.0385,0.0177,0.0054,0.0541,0.1289,0.1765,-0.0268,-0.1029,-0.0934,-0.0109,-0.0047,0.0778,0.1707,-0.1206,-0.0171,0.095,-0.0104,0.0137,0.0834,0.19,0.014,-0.0263,0,-0.1331,-0.0486,-0.0181,0.0709,-0.0625,0.1075,-0.0024,-0.1853,-0.0138,-0.0016,0.2378,0.1635,-0.0667,-0.0869,-0.0405,-0.0634,-0.0536,0.1007,-0.1094,-0.0424,0.0806,-0.1264,0.008,-0.0799,-0.1228,-0.0746,-0.127,-0.0134,0.01,-0.0019,0.0662,0.0341,0.0655,0.0289,0.0331,0.019,-0.0195,0.0381,-0.0174,0.1026,-0.0448,-0.184,-0.0657,0.021,0.1571,0.051,-0.0275,-0.1821,-0.0127,-0.0158,0.0722,-0.1773,-0.042,0.051,0.0112,0.0611,0.1297,0.0658,0.0625,0.0165,0.0617,-0.0685,-0.1138,0.0963],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdJudokaCard.md [chunk 3]","tags":["prd","design-doc","what"],"version":1},

**Vertical Proportions:** With a card width of 260px (height 390px), allocate roughly 14% (55px) for the name and flag bar, 42% (164px) for the portrait, 34% (133px) for stats, and 10% (39px) for the signature move section.\n- Portrait images should fill the portrait area using `object-fit: cover` so no whitespace appears.\n- **Portrait Container:** `.card-portrait` now uses `width: 100%` and `height: 42%` so it matches its flex-basis and keeps the aspect ratio consistent.\n- **Stats Container:** `.card-stats` uses `height: 34%` to align with the vertical proportions.\n- **St","qaContext":"| | | | Signature Move: [Text of move name] | | | | Stats: | | Power: [0-10] Speed: [0-10] | | Technique: [0-10] Kumi-kata (grip fighting): [0-10] | | Ne-waz...","embedding":[-0.1044,0.0924,-0.0128,0.0381,0.0176,-0.0233,0.0971,0.0738,0.0549,-0.1299,0.0342,-0.0547,0.0394,0.0415,0.0681,-0.0099,0.0037,0.0725,-0.0964,0.1386,0.0624,-0.1594,0.1181,-0.0385,-0.0683,0.1601,-0.101,0.0194,-0.0802,-0.1369,0.0073,0.1745,0.0753,-0.0144,-0.0952,-0.0165,-0.0167,0.0296,-0.0616,-0.0802,-0.1106,0.0459,0.0558,0.1138,0.0676,0.0059,-0.0727,-0.0058,-0.0289,0.074,-0.0852,-0.167,0.0254,0.0135,0.0896,0.0247,0.0617,-0.0966,0.1057,0.0466,0.0737,0.1073,0.0432,0.084,0.0094,-0.0869,-0.0063,-0.0825,-0.0513,0.0643,0.0239,-0.0627,-0.0083,-0.096,-0.0411,-0.1127,-0.0443,0.0572,-0.0198,-0.1092,-0.0453,-0.1208,0.0028,0.049,0.1499,0.0333,0.0701,-0.0751,0.0007,-0.105,-0.0956,0.076,0.0379,-0.0235,0.07,-0.0648,-0.0646,-0.1635,-0.1753,0.1839,0.0284,-0.0093,0.084,0.059,0.1221,0.0713,-0.0163,0.0581,0.0011,0.0471,0.0227,-0.0027,-0.0988,0.0093,0.0147,0.0625,-0.0008,0.017,0.0604,0.0158,0.1624,0.0083,-0.1029,-0.0859,0.0089,-0.0058,-0.0285,0,0.0281,-0.1069,-0.0829,0.0429,0.0735,-0.0577,-0.0607,-0.1071,-0.1021,0.0606,-0.0045,0.1743,-0.1015,0.188,0.1283,0.0217,0.0076,0.1127,-0.0269,-0.0612,0.0654,-0.0255,-0.0844,0.0183,-0.041,0.2112,0.0381,-0.0096,-0.0776,-0.006,-0.0624,-0.1548,0.0239,-0.0553,-0.0291,-0.0444,-0.0321,-0.1025,-0.033,0.0603,-0.1093,-0.0549,-0.1092,-0.2221,-0.058,0.0342,0.0941,0.0575,0.0971,0.0559,-0.0606,-0.0414,0.051,-0.0435,-0.0176,-0.1425,0.027,0.1444,0.021,0.0555,-0.0626,-0.0663,-0.0525,-0.0268,-0.0407,0.0539,-0.0017,0.0025,-0.0339,0.0087,-0.0907,0.0851,0.144,0.0293,0.0191,-0.1491,-0.0589,-0.0349,-0.2276,0.1246,-0.0731,0.0315,-0.0196,-0.0653,0.0032,-0.0243,0.1741,-0.0697,-0.1693,0.0456,-0.0941,-0.0051,0.0277,0.0146,-0.0912,0,-0.012,0.0016,-0.0093,0.0869,-0.0094,-0.0159,0.1668,0.1883,0.0185,-0.188,0.0026,0.0488,-0.136,-0.1507,-0.0047,0.1152,-0.0984,0.0303,-0.1521,0.0706,0.0807,0.1105,-0.0435,0.0922,-0.0734,0.053,0.1924,-0.0069,0.0176,-0.06,-0.0043,-0.1206,-0.1528,0.1019,0.0326,-0.0984,-0.0455,0.0506,-0.0412,0.1036,0.0427,0.0615,0.0249,0.0582,0.0438,0.022,0.0464,0.0417,0.0075,-0.0419,0.0204,-0.0735,-0.0241,0.0052,-0.0309,0.0538,0.01,-0.0507,-0.0059,0.0253,0.0129,-0.0865,-0.0186,-0.1293,0.0849,0.1544,-0.0955,0.0126,-0.0402,0.0591,-0.0768,0.0195,0.0454,-0.0265,-0.0442,0.0497,0.1866,0.0272,0.1351,-0.1155,-0.1268,-0.0056,0.0055,-0.0875,0.0139,0.1888,-0.1409,0.0914,0.1038,-0.0615,-0.0703,0.1045,0.206,-0.0495,-0.009,0,-0.1228,0.0314,-0.041,0.0002,-0.0548,0.1591,0.0756,-0.1279,-0.0134,-0.0388,0.1945,0.1333,-0.1284,0.001,-0.0957,-0.0668,-0.0602,0.1837,-0.0827,-0.1331,0.0501,-0.09,0.0693,-0.0155,-0.1305,-0.0885,-0.1163,0.0831,0.0017,-0.0862,0.0669,-0.0245,0.1103,0.0475,0.0619,0.0201,-0.056,0.0984,0.0152,0.0875,-0.0079,-0.1576,-0.0208,-0.0377,0.0791,0.0332,0.0243,-0.1211,0.0247,-0.0084,0.0835,-0.1332,-0.0391,0.0577,0.0751,0.0845,0.1142,-0.008,0.061,0.0475,0.1237,-0.0433,-0.0745,0.0482],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdJudokaCard.md [chunk 5]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},
{"id":"prdJudokaCard.md-chunk-6","text":"**Stats Container:** `.card-stats` uses `height: 34%` to align with the vertical proportions.\n- **Stats Padding & Typography:**\n  - Horizontal padding should be minimal (use `var(--space-small)`).\n  - Stats text uses `--font-medium` and line-height `1.2` to remain legible without increasing panel height.\n- **Signature Move Band (special stat bar):** `height: max(10%, var(--touch-target-size))` keeps the 44px tap target while maintaining the card's 2:3 ratio.\n- The label and value are centered vertically within that band.\n  - `.judoka-card` overrides `--touch-target-size` to `44px` so the band stays 39px tall on a 260×390 card without leaving gaps above or below it.\n- **Padding Adjustments:** Section percentages already account for vertical padding because `.judoka-card` uses `box-sizing: border-box`. No `calc()` subtraction is necessary.\n- **Rarity Border Colors:**\n  - Common → Blue (#337AFF)\n  - Rare → Red (#FF3333)\n  - Legendary → Gold (#FFD700)\n- **Stats Area:** The stats list uses a flex column layout to evenly distribute the stat rows while keeping labels and values aligned.\n- **Contrast & Fonts:**\n  - Text must achieve ≥4.5:1 contrast ratio.\n  - Use **Open Sans** for body text to match the UI design standards.\n- **Interactive Elements:** Carousel arrows or selectors outside the card must have ≥44px tap targets.\n\n### Responsiveness\n\n- **Portrait Priority:** On narrow devices, prioritize portrait and name placement; wrap stats below if needed.\n- **Text Scaling:** Allow dynamic font sizing to avoid clipping on smaller screens.\n\n---\n\n## Integration Notes\n\nCarousels displaying judoka cards **must not** add horizontal padding around each card. Any spacing between cards should rely on the `gap` property defined in the [carousel CSS](../../src/styles/carousel.css). This ensures consistent card widths across screens and matches the rule introduced in the stylesheet.\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] 1.1 Show silhouette placeholder for missing portraits.\n- [ ] 1.2 Cap extreme stats","qaContext":"**Stats Container:** `.","embedding":[-0.0616,0.1455,-0.1371,0.0477,-0.0373,0.0409,0.0816,0.1037,0.0592,-0.1263,-0.0054,-0.0212,0.105,0.0187,0.0673,-0.0163,0.0423,0.0574,-0.111,0.0378,-0.0182,-0.1627,0.099,0.01,-0.1157,0.1921,-0.0914,0.0368,-0.0996,-0.0702,-0.0574,0.191,0.1512,-0.0547,-0.0594,-0.1358,-0.0978,0.0325,-0.119,-0.008,-0.1005,-0.0217,-0.0035,0.1189,0.0852,-0.031,-0.1535,-0.02,-0.0374,0.0949,-0.0783,-0.0298,0.0682,0.0688,0.1246,-0.0111,0.0218,-0.1397,0.1126,-0.0781,0.1062,0.0458,0.0544,0.0856,-0.0059,-0.0606,0.0139,0.0589,-0.0361,0.1387,0.0497,0.0564,-0.0078,0.012,0.1128,0.0463,-0.0681,0.0254,-0.0056,-0.11,-0.088,-0.0996,0.0332,0.1023,0.1685,0.084,0.153,-0.0513,-0.0497,-0.0681,0.0425,0.053,-0.0596,0.0554,-0.1183,-0.1022,-0.0671,-0.1604,-0.1433,0.1298,-0.0083,-0.0555,0.0827,0.0967,-0.0052,-0.1067,-0.0451,0.0617,0.0082,0.0413,0.0475,-0.1115,-0.1347,0.1064,-0.0875,0.0889,-0.0614,0.0094,0.0566,0.0273,0.1172,0.0045,-0.1648,-0.0259,-0.0033,0.0655,-0.0089,0,0.0192,-0.0928,-0.0879,-0.0224,0.105,-0.0767,-0.1343,-0.0622,-0.0536,0.137,0.049,0.1559,-0.0802,0.0736,0.0994,-0.0359,-0.0655,0.071,-0.0987,-0.0282,-0.0224,0.0157,-0.0119,-0.0378,-0.0296,0.2516,-0.0279,-0.0263,-0.0927,0.0478,-0.0848,-0.1145,0.0713,-0.0567,-0.0205,-0.0836,-0.0111,-0.1039,-0.0247,0.1445,-0.1489,0.0263,0.0064,-0.1812,0.0687,-0.0074,0.1616,0.0376,0.0956,0.1037,-0.1245,0.0047,0.1121,-0.1067,0.0196,-0.1703,0.0291,0.1153,0.0039,0.0478,-0.0939,-0.0608,-0.1052,0.0007,0.0287,0.0897,-0.0808,-0.0166,-0.0487,-0.0016,-0.0196,0.0473,0.0741,0.0306,-0.0047,-0.1078,0.0059,0.0412,-0.1876,-0.0619,-0.1677,0.0534,-0.0902,-0.0675,-0.0777,-0.0034,0.1339,-0.0558,-0.1419,0.0064,-0.0675,0.0256,0.0148,0.0119,-0.0796,0,-0.0223,0.0762,0.0254,0.097,0.0238,0.0328,0.1771,0.1389,0.1318,-0.1187,0.0633,0.1079,-0.1697,-0.1385,-0.0537,0.0712,-0.0947,0.0963,-0.1054,-0.0003,0.1388,0.0396,0.0618,0.0845,-0.1237,0.0365,0.1136,-0.0684,-0.0363,-0.0884,-0.0306,-0.1174,-0.123,0.0315,0.0135,-0.1305,-0.0136,0.0502,-0.0327,0.1324,0.0402,0.0133,-0.0388,-0.0242,0.0098,0.0681,0.0906,0.0549,0.0441,-0.1106,0.0026,-0.0432,0.0028,-0.0038,-0.1179,0.0655,-0.0655,-0.0044,-0.028,0.0837,0.0573,0.0281,0.0197,-0.122,0.1201,0.1389,-0.0409,0.0177,-0.0129,0.0809,-0.1084,0.007,0.0583,-0.0112,-0.0744,-0.0538,0.05,0.0151,0.1479,-0.0365,-0.0886,0.0501,0.0045,-0.0666,0.0115,0.1682,-0.0696,0.0422,0.1194,-0.01,-0.0672,0.1383,0.2391,0.0238,-0.0519,0,-0.0412,-0.0238,-0.1045,0.0568,-0.0756,0.0335,0.0299,-0.1087,-0.0236,-0.0032,0.232,0.1502,-0.1247,-0.0452,-0.1076,-0.0751,-0.0711,0.1307,-0.1199,-0.1348,0.0441,-0.1094,0.1185,-0.0557,-0.1009,-0.0748,-0.1114,0.0262,0.0946,-0.0757,0.0929,-0.1042,0.135,0.0533,0.0614,-0.0349,-0.0888,0.0992,0.0655,0.1177,-0.0534,-0.1584,-0.0555,-0.0035,0.0418,-0.0833,0.0008,-0.0722,-0.0314,-0.0107,0.0779,-0.1543,-0.0581,-0.0097,0.0733,-0.0053,0.0715,0.0534,0.02,-0.0007,0.0788,-0.0272,-0.0551,0.0608],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdJudokaCard.md [chunk 6]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

Portraits should be pre-cropped as needed, and `.card-portrait` uses `object-fit: cover` to handle similarly shaped images. Card sizing calculations must account for screen aspect ratios and resolutions to preserve this ratio.\n- Hover and focus scaling must stay at or below **1.05x** to prevent cards from being clipped inside scroll wrappers.\n\n---","qaContext":"Technical Considerations - Portrait images should use optimized formats (e.","embedding":[-0.0843,0.138,-0.1035,0.0624,-0.0347,0.0071,-0.033,0.0469,0.0045,-0.1578,0.0314,-0.0887,0.0241,0.0514,0.1152,-0.0729,0.095,0.1028,-0.0014,0.189,-0.0424,-0.2818,0.0982,-0.0772,-0.0685,0.1035,0.0518,-0.0617,-0.068,-0.1004,0.0003,0.1761,0.087,-0.0831,-0.0344,0.0163,-0.0205,0.0958,-0.1112,-0.0199,-0.1467,0.0033,0.034,0.0986,0.1874,-0.0353,0.0333,0.0688,-0.0156,0.0422,-0.1712,-0.097,0.0464,0.0384,0.089,-0.0591,0.0303,-0.1015,-0.0263,0.0398,0.009,0.0726,0.0314,0.0813,-0.1318,-0.107,0.0754,-0.0379,0.0443,0.1085,-0.0521,-0.0193,-0.0974,-0.1188,-0.0343,-0.0108,0.0391,-0.0503,0.0612,-0.1365,0.0331,-0.0492,0.0638,0.0458,0.08,0.0136,0.1289,0.0069,-0.0519,0.047,0.0952,0.0909,-0.0044,-0.0252,0.0476,-0.1183,-0.0696,-0.0554,-0.0946,0.0693,-0.0003,-0.111,0.234,0.1469,0.0678,-0.0178,0.0211,0.0715,0.03,-0.0124,0.0392,-0.0173,-0.131,0.0198,0.0613,0.198,-0.0618,-0.0819,0.037,0.0812,0.0752,-0.0388,0.0228,-0.0953,0.047,0.0342,-0.037,0,-0.0125,-0.0311,-0.0118,0.0943,-0.0782,-0.1014,-0.032,-0.1328,-0.0114,0.1047,0.0421,0.0976,-0.0348,0.2582,0.043,-0.042,-0.1098,0.1019,0.008,0.0525,0.0447,-0.1155,-0.0642,-0.0293,-0.0048,0.2658,0.0592,-0.0367,-0.0286,0.0605,-0.058,-0.1781,-0.0516,-0.054,-0.1204,-0.0183,-0.0527,-0.1188,-0.008,0.1327,-0.1056,0.0422,-0.0786,-0.1361,0.0078,-0.0142,0.1213,0.1063,0.045,0.1872,-0.083,0.027,0.1013,0.0015,-0.0916,-0.0906,0.0737,0.0129,-0.0126,-0.0324,-0.0671,-0.1395,-0.2288,0.0068,-0.0231,-0.0129,-0.0285,-0.0692,-0.1877,0.0334,-0.0286,0.0533,0.0663,-0.0017,-0.0245,0,-0.0337,0.1472,-0.2566,0.1785,-0.1728,0.1986,-0.0041,-0.0768,-0.0553,-0.0162,0.1911,0.0148,-0.1172,0.0519,0.0335,0.0893,0.0515,0.0392,-0.0096,0,0.0075,0.0182,-0.0391,0.069,0.0083,0.002,0.1389,0.1667,0.0464,-0.2596,-0.0102,0.0587,-0.1878,-0.1129,-0.0758,-0.0233,-0.026,0.0412,-0.1034,0.0243,0.2091,0.057,0.0654,0.0968,-0.0895,0.1226,0.1261,-0.1004,-0.0267,-0.0085,-0.0077,-0.1652,0.0037,0.0964,0.0149,-0.0342,-0.157,0.0558,-0.001,0.2346,0.0677,0.0728,-0.13,0.0816,-0.0223,-0.0452,-0.0663,-0.0485,0.0765,-0.0755,-0.0693,-0.0266,0.0266,-0.0848,-0.1204,-0.0312,0.0631,-0.0191,0.0924,0.0926,-0.0281,-0.0994,-0.0067,-0.2412,-0.1305,0.0929,-0.0714,0.0514,0.0436,0.0189,-0.1734,-0.0036,0.0611,0.0494,-0.1011,-0.0005,0.1181,0.1018,0.2885,-0.1013,-0.0727,-0.0603,-0.0344,-0.0679,0.0667,0.1344,-0.1049,-0.0762,0.0985,-0.0112,-0.0616,0.1193,0.2245,0.0764,-0.0618,0,-0.1052,-0.0237,0.0308,0.1048,-0.1417,0.0644,0.0553,-0.1691,-0.0231,-0.0311,0.2161,0.0897,-0.0085,-0.0008,0.0569,-0.0658,0.0432,0.1104,-0.1054,-0.1687,-0.0264,-0.0758,0.0483,-0.1068,-0.0803,-0.0205,-0.039,-0.0254,-0.001,-0.0054,-0.0079,0.089,-0.0172,-0.0043,0.025,-0.0016,-0.1154,0.0165,0.0198,0.1435,-0.0714,-0.1389,-0.0485,-0.1009,0.0292,0.0062,0.0023,-0.1181,-0.0727,-0.0102,0.0786,-0.164,-0.0332,0.089,0.0743,0.1118,0.1836,0.0162,0.1336,0.0408,-0.0103,-0.0379,-0.1287,0.031],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdJudokaCard.md [chunk 14]","tags":["prd","design-doc","what"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdJudokaCard.md-chunk-23","text":"### Layout & Design Notes\n\n- **Aspect Ratio:** Card must strictly maintain **2:3 ratio**, adjusting internal elements responsively.\n- **Safari ≤15 Fallback:** `.judoka-card` sets `height: calc(var(--card-width) * 1.5)` because these versions do not treat `aspect-ratio` as a definite height. `.card-top-bar` uses `calc(var(--card-width) * 0.14)` so the header stays the same height across browsers.\n  - **Vertical Proportions:** With a card width of 260px (height 390px), allocate roughly 14% (55px) for the name and flag bar, 42% (164px) for the portrait, 34% (133px) for stats, and 10% (39px) for the signature move section.\n- Portrait images should fill the portrait area using `object-fit: cover` so no whitespace appears.\n- **Portrait Container:** `.card-portrait` now uses `width: 100%` and `height: 42%` so it matches its flex-basis and keeps the aspect ratio consistent.\n- **Stats Container:** `.card-stats` uses `height: 34%` to align with the vertical proportions.\n- **Stats Padding & Typography:**\n  - Horizontal padding should be minimal (use `var(--space-small)`).\n  - Stats text uses `--font-medium` and line-height `1.2` to remain legible without increasing panel height.\n- **Signature Move Band (special stat bar):** `height: max(10%, var(--touch-target-size))` keeps the 44px tap target while maintaining the card's 2:3 ratio.\n- The label and value are centered vertically within that band.\n  - `.judoka-card` overrides `--touch-target-size` to `44px` so the band stays 39px tall on a 260×390 card without leaving gaps above or below it.\n- **Padding Adjustments:** Section percentages already account for vertical padding because `.judoka-card` uses `box-sizing: border-box`. No `calc()` subtraction is necessary.\n- **Rarity Border Colors:**\n  - Common → Blue (#337AFF)\n  - Rare → Red (#FF3333)\n  - Legendary → Gold (#FFD700)\n- **Stats Area:** The stats list uses a flex column layout to evenly distribute the stat rows while keeping labels and values aligned.\n- **Contrast & Fonts:*","qaContext":"Layout & Design Notes - **Aspect Ratio:** Card must strictly maintain **2:3 ratio**, adjusting internal elements responsively.","embedding":[-0.0758,0.1271,-0.0892,0.0753,0.0161,0.0105,0.0242,0.123,0.0056,-0.1229,0.0068,-0.0547,0.0649,0.0248,0.1027,-0.0498,0.0338,0.1217,-0.0956,0.1612,-0.0422,-0.1733,0.1246,0.0019,-0.1139,0.181,-0.0099,0.0047,-0.1068,-0.1323,-0.0006,0.2526,0.1098,-0.0252,-0.0587,-0.1007,-0.0763,0.0326,-0.0791,-0.0699,-0.1327,0.0456,-0.0171,0.1463,0.0441,-0.0003,-0.0677,0.0565,-0.067,0.0218,-0.102,-0.1098,-0.0015,0.0783,0.0701,0.0032,0.0076,-0.0842,0.0931,0.028,0.0973,0.0829,0.0164,0.0966,-0.0044,-0.112,-0.0064,-0.0304,-0.0507,0.109,0.0199,-0.0226,0.0182,-0.0644,0.0369,-0.0146,-0.0222,0.0834,0.0632,-0.0682,-0.0656,-0.1018,0.0237,0.0661,0.1092,0.0226,0.1599,-0.0412,-0.0697,-0.0697,0.0224,0.0893,-0.0132,0.0242,-0.0537,-0.122,-0.0823,-0.1001,-0.1115,0.1255,-0.004,-0.0369,0.0776,0.1285,0.0642,-0.0167,-0.041,0.0821,0.0599,0.0578,0.0004,-0.0666,-0.158,0.1195,-0.0022,0.1169,0.0032,0.0085,0.0398,-0.0041,0.0549,-0.0075,-0.0991,-0.0919,-0.0271,0.0335,-0.0043,0,0.0464,-0.1177,-0.0811,0.0323,0.0622,-0.0835,-0.0743,-0.0635,-0.0523,0.0945,-0.0272,0.1491,-0.104,0.2172,0.1065,0.0144,-0.0903,0.0918,-0.0544,0.0212,0.0328,0.0181,-0.0362,-0.0241,-0.0167,0.1845,0.0043,-0.0404,-0.1423,0.0462,-0.0531,-0.179,0.0301,-0.0326,-0.0395,-0.0593,-0.0193,-0.0642,-0.064,0.0725,-0.1647,0.0316,-0.0362,-0.2534,-0.0126,-0.0108,0.1486,0.0523,0.1198,0.0958,-0.0754,-0.0304,0.1342,-0.0839,-0.0389,-0.1497,0.0198,0.1403,0.0391,0.0964,-0.1114,-0.109,-0.1419,0.0062,0.02,0.0251,-0.0176,-0.0019,-0.0699,0.0166,-0.0369,0.0739,0.1312,0.0833,-0.0262,-0.1151,-0.0361,0.0488,-0.2379,0.0844,-0.1222,0.133,0.0425,-0.0805,-0.0836,-0.0044,0.1896,-0.0314,-0.1151,0.0419,-0.0394,0.0073,0.0803,0.0105,-0.037,0,-0.0173,-0.0165,-0.0168,0.0191,-0.0442,0.0234,0.1419,0.2071,0.0485,-0.1961,0.0202,0.0514,-0.158,-0.124,-0.0657,0.0755,-0.1249,-0.0468,-0.1481,-0.0038,0.1315,0.0527,0.0353,0.0462,-0.048,-0.0003,0.1749,0.0237,0.0217,-0.0491,0.01,-0.151,-0.1017,0.0906,0.0311,-0.1683,-0.0969,0.0735,0.009,0.0947,0.026,0.0514,-0.0444,-0.0352,0.0637,0.0459,0.0997,0.0398,0.0549,-0.1108,-0.0042,-0.0406,0.0449,0.0233,-0.0771,0.063,-0.0306,-0.0233,0.0056,0.0274,0.0589,-0.0318,0.0356,-0.1768,0.0962,0.1613,-0.1011,-0.0052,-0.0327,0.0583,-0.1093,-0.0215,-0.0108,0.0461,-0.0796,-0.0439,0.1273,0.0533,0.162,-0.0835,-0.111,0.0225,-0.0643,-0.1008,0.0547,0.1734,-0.0923,0.0382,0.1015,-0.0329,-0.0695,0.1199,0.1735,0.011,-0.0643,0,-0.0562,-0.0652,-0.1079,0.1107,-0.0856,0.1062,0.0843,-0.1085,0.0196,-0.0098,0.189,0.1329,-0.1248,-0.0184,-0.1253,-0.0898,-0.0628,0.1427,-0.1047,-0.1349,0.0322,-0.0959,0.1417,-0.0252,-0.0709,-0.0147,-0.1108,0.051,0.0286,-0.0897,0.042,-0.0402,0.098,-0.0011,0.0436,-0.0019,-0.0181,0.0858,0.0684,0.1016,-0.0146,-0.1856,0.004,-0.0604,0.1462,-0.0418,0.0371,-0.048,-0.0146,-0.0283,0.079,-0.1253,-0.0377,0.0103,0.0517,0.0308,0.0581,-0.0245,0.0286,-0.0195,0.0764,-0.0493,-0.0502,0.0533],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdJudokaCard.md [chunk 23]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdHomePageNavigation.md-chunk-1","text":"# PRD: Home Page Main Navigation Menu\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nProvides a fast, 2x2 tile menu so players can reach Classic Battle, Random Judoka, Meditation, and Browse Judoka within two taps. Layout loads in under 2s, remains accessible and responsive across devices.\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis document describes the **Home Page Main Navigation Menu** for the JU-DO-KON! web-based judo-themed card battle game.\n\n> Imagine a new player, Ayumi, who’s just downloaded JU-DO-KON! after seeing a cool TikTok clip. She opens the game and instantly lands on a vibrant home screen where “Classic Battle” and “Random Judoka” tiles stand side by side, each pulsing slightly when she hovers. The judo-inspired icons draw her in, and she feels like she’s stepping onto the tatami mat (training mat). She sees “Meditation” and “Browse Judoka” neatly below, feeling in control and excited. Within seconds, she launches into her first match, confident she’s chosen the right mode. She tells her friends how easy it was to start. That’s the experience we’re building: immediate clarity, thematic immersion, and frictionless engagement.\n\nThe purpose of this menu is to allow players to access the core game modes quickly and intuitively. New players struggle to find and understand game modes quickly, leading to frustration, early churn, and reduced engagement. A clear, immersive, and fast-loading navigation menu is needed to orient players instantly (**menu load ≤2 s**), maintain the judo theme, and ensure accessibility across devices.\n\n> **Player Feedback Example**: \"I want to play the Team Battle, but I can't see the right button.\" — hypothetical playtest participant, age 10\n\nA fast, accessible, and thematic navigation experience is crucial to ensure new players feel confident and engaged from their first visit.\n\nThe list of available modes is defined in `gameModes.json`. `navigationItems.json` references each mode by `id` to control which tiles appear on the home page and in what order.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n- ","qaContext":"PRD: Home Page Main Navigation Menu --- ## TL;DR Provides a fast, 2x2 tile menu so players can reach Classic Battle, Random Judoka, Meditation, and Browse Ju...","embedding":[-0.0394,0.0352,0.0327,-0.0236,-0.0074,0.0615,0.079,0.0258,0.0421,0.0704,-0.0194,-0.09,0.0363,0.0052,0.0908,-0.0181,0.0793,0.0681,-0.0605,0.0733,0.0382,-0.1824,0.0653,-0.0438,-0.1091,0.0637,-0.0271,0.0432,-0.0983,-0.1273,0.0083,0.1587,0.0014,0.0182,-0.1673,0.0091,-0.068,-0.0253,-0.113,-0.0762,-0.1648,0.0523,0.0283,0.1029,0.0924,-0.0556,-0.0271,-0.0803,0.0659,0.0201,-0.2264,-0.1171,-0.001,-0.0801,0.0808,0.0435,-0.0023,0.0687,0.0295,0.0704,0.0543,-0.0322,0.0211,0.0653,0.0364,-0.0993,0.0545,0.0459,0.0267,0.0521,0.0259,-0.0257,0.082,-0.01,0.0883,-0.0648,-0.0092,-0.056,-0.0574,-0.1248,0.0587,0.032,-0.0404,0.0697,-0.0285,-0.0525,0.0481,-0.0254,0.0822,0.0086,0.0042,0.1132,0.0076,-0.0039,0.0888,-0.0302,0.0044,-0.0418,-0.0818,0.1352,0.0223,0.06,0.1583,0.1486,0.0376,-0.0866,0.1477,-0.0238,-0.0753,0.0612,-0.0081,-0.0369,-0.1676,-0.0193,-0.1013,0.1041,-0.0422,0.0606,0.0998,0.1888,0.1154,-0.135,-0.0339,-0.0721,0.1123,-0.0159,-0.1048,0,0.054,-0.1245,-0.0537,0.1038,0.0349,-0.0976,0.0766,-0.1624,-0.0989,0.0395,-0.047,0.1579,-0.1038,0.1456,0.16,-0.127,-0.2042,0.0241,-0.0804,0.0112,0.1415,0.0348,-0.0665,-0.0975,-0.0088,0.1583,0.0529,0.0124,-0.0941,0.0627,-0.1118,-0.1261,-0.1352,-0.0511,-0.0649,-0.0345,0.0249,-0.0821,0.0154,-0.034,-0.1533,-0.0565,-0.0184,0.0238,-0.1503,-0.1303,0.0029,-0.0214,-0.0059,0.0863,-0.0968,0.034,0.1096,-0.089,-0.055,-0.0808,0.0617,0.0346,-0.0174,0.0824,-0.0049,-0.1408,-0.0585,0.0823,0.0229,0.1177,-0.0268,-0.0587,0.1114,-0.1692,-0.1777,0.0134,0.1644,-0.0681,-0.0766,-0.0879,-0.0334,-0.0356,-0.1305,-0.0351,0.0408,-0.0097,-0.1027,0.1173,-0.0255,-0.0324,0.0904,-0.1611,-0.1699,0.0489,-0.0716,0.0541,0.0748,0.0389,-0.0031,0,0.0329,-0.0763,-0.0922,0.1094,0.0724,-0.0251,0.1048,0.0814,-0.0225,-0.0913,0.0077,0.0721,-0.0257,-0.0423,-0.0352,0.0901,0.0713,0.045,-0.094,0.0693,0.0747,0.1544,-0.0058,-0.0988,0.0146,0.0292,0.1682,0.0226,-0.0071,0.0445,0.0781,-0.0916,-0.0879,0.0035,0.1219,0.0449,-0.0137,-0.0315,-0.1515,0.1317,0.1408,0.0076,-0.0173,0.0417,0.0423,0.1625,0.0101,0.0382,-0.0847,-0.0284,0.0808,0.0131,-0.0105,-0.2307,-0.0278,-0.0952,-0.0332,-0.043,0.0368,0.0552,0.1472,-0.0235,-0.1017,-0.0032,0.0617,0.0732,-0.1352,0.0407,-0.025,0.088,-0.1903,-0.0196,-0.0031,-0.0901,0.0709,0.0566,-0.0063,0.0175,0.0488,-0.0736,-0.0348,0.0609,-0.0045,-0.0705,0.0602,0.1902,-0.1409,0.1155,0.0463,-0.0365,0.1271,0.0129,0.0639,0.1152,-0.0581,0,-0.1013,0.0152,-0.0049,0.0344,0.0191,0.0557,-0.0258,-0.106,-0.0473,0.0476,0.1938,0.0814,-0.0537,0.0499,0.0455,0.1006,-0.0197,0.1065,-0.1477,0.0124,0.0693,-0.0423,-0.0256,-0.062,-0.0856,0.0862,-0.1982,0.0129,0.0408,-0.0787,0.0793,-0.0483,-0.0333,0.0453,-0.0998,0.1388,0.0016,0.03,-0.0021,0.0393,-0.0617,-0.1384,-0.0203,0.0069,-0.0661,0.0483,-0.0278,-0.0876,0.0339,-0.0624,-0.0657,-0.095,-0.0185,-0.0379,0.1086,0.1233,0.0827,0.0489,0.0843,0.1056,0.0669,0.0833,-0.2143,0.0543],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdHomePageNavigation.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

Tile navigable via keyboard (Tab navigation, Enter/Space activation).\n- Ensure all icons and text meet WCAG AA contrast ratio (minimum 4.5:1).\n- SVG icons <50KB to optimize load times.\n- SVG icons use Material Symbols and require `viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\"` to render correctly.\n- Fallback icon (JU-DO-KON logo) displayed if SVG fails to load.\n- Quickly and confidently access desired game modes **(≤2 taps from landing)**.\n- Experience a navigation interface that feels consistent with the judo theme.\n- Navigate easily regardless of device or ability.\n\n---\n## Non-Goals\n\n- The home page will not expose account or profile management.\n- Advanced battle or team composition settings are out of scope.\n\n---\n\n## User Stories\n\n- As a new player, I want to see all game modes clearly when I launch the game so that I don't get lost.\n- As a player using keyboard-only navigation, I want to move between tiles using Tab and select using Enter/Space so that I can navigate without a mouse.\n- As a visually impaired player, I want tile icons and labels with sufficient contrast and screen reader support so I can access the game.\n\n---\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n###

{"id":"prdHomePageNavigation.md-chunk-11","text":"## Introduction\n\nThis document describes the **Home Page Main Navigation Menu** for the JU-DO-KON! web-based judo-themed card battle game.\n\n> Imagine a new player, Ayumi, who’s just downloaded JU-DO-KON! after seeing a cool TikTok clip. She opens the game and instantly lands on a vibrant home screen where “Classic Battle” and “Random Judoka” tiles stand side by side, each pulsing slightly when she hovers. The judo-inspired icons draw her in, and she feels like she’s stepping onto the tatami mat (training mat). She sees “Meditation” and “Browse Judoka” neatly below, feeling in control and excited. Within seconds, she launches into her first match, confident she’s chosen the right mode. She tells her friends how easy it was to start. That’s the experience we’re building: immediate clarity, thematic immersion, and frictionless engagement.\n\nThe purpose of this menu is to allow players to access the core game modes quickly and intuitively. New players struggle to find and understand game modes quickly, leading to frustration, early churn, and reduced engagement. A clear, immersive, and fast-loading navigation menu is needed to orient players instantly (**menu load ≤2 s**), maintain the judo theme, and ensure accessibility across devices.\n\n> **Player Feedback Example**: \"I want to play the Team Battle, but I can't see the right button.\" — hypothetical playtest participant, age 10\n\nA fast, accessible, and thematic navigation experience is crucial to ensure new players feel confident and engaged from their first visit.\n\nThe list of available modes is defined in `gameModes.json`. `navigationItems.json` references each mode by `id` to control which tiles appear on the home page and in what order.\n\n---","qaContext":"Introduction This document describes the **Home Page Main Navigation Menu** for the JU-DO-KON!","embedding":[-0.0317,0.0535,0.0261,-0.0222,-0.0151,0.0808,0.1369,-0.0074,0.0415,0.0498,-0.0217,-0.0699,0.0538,-0.0025,0.1043,-0.0128,0.0798,0.0713,-0.0497,0.0679,0.0666,-0.1814,0.0508,-0.0315,-0.1142,0.0472,-0.0171,0.036,-0.0583,-0.0956,-0.0014,0.1553,0.0455,0.0255,-0.156,0.0379,-0.0385,-0.047,-0.094,-0.0312,-0.1208,0.0458,0.0213,0.0851,0.0954,-0.049,0.0071,-0.062,0.0472,0.0258,-0.2172,-0.1168,-0.01,-0.1198,0.0971,0.0391,-0.0028,0.041,0.0325,0.0703,0.0395,-0.0125,0.0196,0.059,0.0419,-0.1521,0.0651,0.0931,0.0413,0.0476,0.0442,-0.0426,0.0858,-0.0143,0.0291,-0.045,-0.0155,-0.0233,-0.0442,-0.1398,0.041,0.0278,-0.0132,0.0596,-0.0201,-0.0386,0.0465,-0.0209,0.0944,0.0297,0.0115,0.0753,0.0062,-0.0143,0.0637,-0.0085,-0.0116,-0.0658,-0.0506,0.1504,0.0362,0.0499,0.1549,0.1337,0.0247,-0.0715,0.1125,0.008,-0.0549,0.0712,-0.0333,-0.046,-0.1451,-0.0112,-0.1084,0.1382,-0.0139,0.0296,0.0901,0.1862,0.1332,-0.1561,0.0123,-0.0714,0.1043,0.0152,-0.1129,0,0.0753,-0.1142,-0.0254,0.1075,0.011,-0.1055,0.0656,-0.2081,-0.1136,0.0761,-0.0602,0.1535,-0.0875,0.1481,0.1285,-0.1208,-0.2022,-0.0443,-0.0433,-0.0242,0.1056,0.0244,-0.0683,-0.0797,-0.0057,0.1244,0.0367,0.004,-0.1067,0.0603,-0.0528,-0.136,-0.1376,-0.0476,-0.043,0.0126,0.0104,-0.0754,0.0223,-0.0101,-0.149,-0.0703,-0.0447,0.0418,-0.1514,-0.1022,-0.0271,-0.055,-0.0048,0.0996,-0.0889,0.0198,0.1247,-0.0776,-0.06,-0.0349,0.0393,0.0153,-0.0375,0.0326,-0.0203,-0.174,-0.0364,0.087,0.024,0.1078,-0.0247,-0.077,0.1105,-0.1745,-0.1554,0.0379,0.1254,-0.0883,-0.0886,-0.0901,-0.039,-0.0054,-0.1284,-0.0188,0.058,-0.0246,-0.0965,0.1194,-0.0194,-0.0125,0.1093,-0.1549,-0.1643,0.0265,-0.0523,0.0828,0.0757,0.0224,-0.0116,0,0.0608,-0.04,-0.083,0.0901,0.0249,-0.0476,0.0957,0.0667,-0.0404,-0.0818,-0.0165,0.0591,-0.0193,-0.0575,-0.0501,0.0478,0.0557,0.0478,-0.0835,0.0697,0.0572,0.0761,0.0105,-0.1193,0.0064,0.0218,0.1719,-0.0036,-0.0192,0.0484,0.0658,-0.1048,-0.0638,0.0218,0.1076,0.025,0.0065,-0.0366,-0.137,0.1305,0.1169,0.0065,-0.0256,0.0375,0.0107,0.1708,-0.002,0.0586,-0.1142,-0.0489,0.0789,-0.0011,-0.0271,-0.2172,-0.0238,-0.1056,-0.0027,-0.0196,0.0059,0.0812,0.1219,-0.0445,-0.0964,-0.0118,0.0468,0.0471,-0.1387,0.0284,-0.0119,0.0552,-0.1786,-0.0194,0.0001,-0.0667,0.0339,0.0374,-0.009,0.0069,0.0452,-0.0729,-0.0432,0.0607,-0.0347,-0.0734,0.0608,0.2015,-0.1341,0.148,0.0416,-0.0351,0.137,0.0165,0.0842,0.1061,-0.0795,0,-0.1373,-0.0106,-0.0143,0.0245,-0.0068,0.091,-0.0019,-0.1288,-0.0172,0.0367,0.2047,0.1123,-0.0552,0.0301,0.0299,0.0926,-0.0059,0.0905,-0.137,0.0507,0.0715,-0.0578,-0.0312,-0.0228,-0.0613,0.0765,-0.2055,0.0383,0.001,-0.0657,0.0836,-0.0451,-0.028,0.0644,-0.1103,0.1365,-0.0166,-0.0016,-0.0054,0.0407,-0.0694,-0.1461,-0.026,-0.0258,-0.0433,0.0716,-0.0191,-0.0883,0.018,-0.0743,-0.0551,-0.0763,-0.0016,-0.0143,0.0827,0.1087,0.0919,0.0871,0.1075,0.1035,0.0233,0.0763,-0.2018,0.0204],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdHomePageNavigation.md [chunk 11]","tags":["prd","design-doc","how"],"version":1},

Without this, Team Battle feels like a weak afterthought.

{"id":"prdGameModes.md-chunk-1","text":"# Ju-Do-Kon! Game Modes – Product Requirements Document\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\n**Ju-Do-Kon!** offers a range of game modes tailored for different play styles—competitive battles, team-based challenges, creative customization, exploratory discovery, and quiet reflection. These modes diversify the experience, increase replayability, and promote deeper engagement.\n\n> After a tough **Classic Battle**, Hiroshi takes a break by entering **Meditation** Mode. Soft music and inspiring quotes help him reconnect with why he loves judo. Later, he updates his Judoka’s signature move, making his fighter truly his own. By offering more than just battles, Ju-Do-Kon! becomes a game players want to return to every day—whether they crave intense combat or quiet reflection.\n\n## Game mode IDs are numeric. Each navigation item references a mode by its ID in `navigationItems.json`.\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nReturning players often exit after short sessions due to repetitive gameplay loops and limited creative expression.\n\n---\n\n### User Stories\n\n- As a player who’s tired of pure competition, I want a Meditation mode so I can relax and still feel connected to the game.\n- As a player with a favorite judoka, I want to update their stats and appearance so they grow with me.\n\n---\n\n### Why It Matters Now\n\nImproving session variety directly supports retention and encourages more personalized play, especially as competition from other collectible games increases.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n### KPI Targets\n\n- Increase returning player average session length by **20%**.\n- At least **80%** of users who begin a Team Battle complete the match.\n- **70%** of new players use Judoka Creation within their first week.\n- **60%** of all players trigger Meditation mode at least once weekly.\n\n### Player Experience Goals _(qualitative)_\n\n- Players experience diverse ways to interact with their judoka.\n- Players find modes matching their mood: competitive, creative, or relaxing.\n\n---\n\n## Common Non-Functional Requirements\n\n- All game","qaContext":"Ju-Do-Kon!","embedding":[0.0078,0.0871,0.0797,0.0089,0.0003,0.1561,0.2406,0.0313,0.0211,0.0073,-0.05,-0.0883,0.0772,0.0294,0.1388,0.073,0.056,0.1509,-0.1208,0.0381,0.1174,-0.14,0.1192,0.0179,-0.0682,0.0486,-0.021,-0.0503,-0.0838,-0.0397,-0.036,0.2431,0.0657,-0.0385,-0.0626,0.0307,-0.0772,0.0661,-0.038,-0.0635,-0.1462,0.01,0.0405,0.0874,0.076,-0.0582,-0.0773,-0.1098,-0.0291,0.0326,-0.1871,-0.0735,0.005,-0.0337,0.1769,-0.013,-0.0384,0.1229,-0.0269,0.08,0.0436,-0.051,-0.0525,-0.0201,0.0295,-0.1278,0.0041,0.0782,-0.02,0.148,-0.03,0.0201,-0.0063,0.006,0.0349,0.0584,-0.1038,-0.0877,-0.0346,-0.0929,0.0015,0.043,-0.082,-0.0486,0.0754,-0.084,0.0684,-0.0824,0.0944,0.0793,-0.0174,0.1141,0.0419,-0.0349,0.0631,0.0528,-0.0368,-0.0176,0.04,0.1075,0.0461,0.1064,0.0725,0.0506,-0.0178,-0.0939,0.0377,0.0194,-0.1004,0.1,-0.0798,0.0388,-0.1113,-0.0457,0.0232,0.1469,-0.0218,0.0487,0.0352,0.1801,0.2166,-0.1369,0.0706,0.0683,0.0598,0.054,-0.0268,0,0.0896,-0.0886,-0.0048,0.1234,-0.0355,-0.0616,-0.0334,-0.145,-0.1102,-0.0302,-0.1343,0.1821,-0.0463,0.1336,0.1368,-0.0831,-0.1784,0.0385,-0.0092,-0.0026,0.172,-0.0064,-0.0706,0.0305,-0.0165,0.0446,0.0638,-0.0891,-0.184,0.0335,-0.0115,-0.1434,-0.1649,0.011,-0.0446,0.0684,0.0571,-0.008,-0.013,-0.0438,-0.1368,-0.0279,-0.12,0.0302,-0.0518,-0.1448,-0.0447,-0.0483,-0.0203,0.045,-0.0542,0.0529,0.1303,-0.1182,-0.0676,-0.0357,0.0752,-0.024,-0.0878,0.045,-0.0312,-0.089,-0.0734,0.0483,0.001,0.0781,-0.0751,-0.1238,0.0713,-0.1006,-0.0318,0.0506,-0.0024,-0.1277,-0.077,-0.2093,-0.0817,0.0834,-0.1121,-0.0385,0.0683,-0.0116,-0.2608,0.0762,-0.0189,0.0324,0.034,-0.1788,-0.1997,0.0653,-0.0323,-0.0001,0.0513,0.0777,-0.0322,0,0.0191,-0.0424,0.0079,0.0674,0.0808,0.0275,-0.0175,0.0851,-0.0219,-0.1436,-0.0306,-0.0207,-0.0412,-0.0293,-0.1027,-0.0495,-0.0584,0.0449,-0.0814,0.1473,0.1474,0.1737,-0.0398,-0.0892,-0.0757,0.0159,0.0311,0.0427,0.0455,0.0319,0.0699,-0.0678,-0.1413,-0.02,0.0836,-0.0476,-0.02,-0.007,-0.1836,0.2309,0.1539,0.0035,-0.0534,0.0505,0.0808,0.0609,0.0001,-0.078,-0.0335,-0.009,0.1114,-0.096,-0.1621,-0.1401,-0.0975,-0.0439,-0.0749,-0.1302,-0.0679,0.0543,0.0772,-0.0236,-0.0296,0.0234,0.0503,-0.0387,-0.0536,0.0846,-0.0253,-0.0336,-0.0828,-0.013,0.0582,-0.0349,0.0245,-0.0247,-0.1085,-0.0112,0.0532,0.0114,-0.1143,0.0328,0.0272,-0.0496,0.0093,0.2665,-0.0961,0.1782,-0.0104,-0.0182,0.0895,0.0067,0.0332,0.0747,-0.0458,0,-0.1069,-0.1239,-0.0465,0.0983,0.0676,0.0499,-0.0962,-0.1745,-0.0255,0.008,0.2538,0.0699,-0.0859,0.0641,0.0578,-0.0233,-0.0006,0.1092,-0.1535,0.0488,0.0159,-0.0087,-0.0792,-0.0902,-0.0364,0.0344,-0.1537,0.0595,0.0306,-0.0487,0.1248,0.0182,-0.0176,0.0762,-0.1013,0.0575,0.067,-0.017,-0.0373,0.0846,-0.0835,-0.1319,0,0.0739,0.0458,-0.0396,-0.0219,-0.08,0.0626,-0.0636,-0.0029,-0.1032,-0.0299,-0.0634,0.0409,0.1327,0.0463,0.1113,0.1027,0.0022,0.107,-0.0146,-0.1625,0.048],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdGameModes.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdDrawRandomCard.md-chunk-1","text":"# PRD: Draw Random Card Function\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThis PRD defines the Draw Random Card function for Ju-Do-Kon!, providing a fast, engaging, and accessible way to select random cards during matches. The feature increases excitement, replayability, and average session time, with performance targets of ≤300ms draw speed and ≥60fps animations.\n\n> Hiroshi faces his rival in Ju-Do-Kon!’s Classic Battle. He taps “Draw Card!” — a new Judoka card slides onto the screen, its stats flashing dramatically. Hiroshi’s heart races, knowing the outcome could change the match. This suspense keeps players coming back for more, fueling longer, more thrilling sessions.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nAs part of the web browser-based game **Ju-Do-Kon!**, players often need to draw a random card during matches. This mechanic injects vital excitement and unpredictability, ensuring players never know what card will come next. The uncertainty heightens the tension of one-on-one battles, making matches feel dynamic, surprising, and deeply engaging.\n\nWithout this feature, players would be forced to pre-select cards, leading to predictable, repetitive gameplay that diminishes replayability and player engagement.\n\n**Playtest feedback:**\n\n> “I love not knowing what card will pop up next — it makes it so much more exciting!” — Sanshiro, age 10\n\n**This function is critical for:**\n\n- Enhancing pacing — sustaining game flow without manual selection delays.\n- Increasing replayability — ensuring different match outcomes on each playthrough.\n- Boosting session duration — expected to increase session time by at least 10% due to heightened player engagement and tension.\n\n---\n\n## User Stories\n\n- As a player who loves surprises, I want each card draw to feel random so battles stay exciting.\n- As a player sensitive to motion, I want to disable animations so I can play comfortably.\n- As a parent watching my child play, I want the draw button to be large and responsive so they can use it easily.\n\n---\n\n## How It Wo","qaContext":"PRD: Draw Random Card Function --- ## TL;DR This PRD defines the Draw Random Card function for Ju-Do-Kon!","embedding":[-0.0625,0.0862,0.0609,-0.0021,0.0275,0.1683,0.1817,0.0736,0.1859,0.0286,-0.0678,-0.0898,-0.0947,0.0844,0.047,-0.0638,0.1228,0.0937,-0.1235,0.0834,0.1384,-0.2288,0.1461,-0.0185,-0.0358,-0.0491,-0.0461,-0.0436,-0.1053,-0.0913,0.0377,0.1884,0.1362,-0.0913,-0.1815,-0.0514,-0.1214,0.0462,-0.1024,-0.0803,-0.1582,0.0482,0.0091,0.0285,0.0526,-0.0047,-0.0444,-0.0843,-0.1134,0.1154,-0.1466,-0.0505,0.0638,-0.0698,0.184,0.0509,0.0303,-0.0076,0.0059,-0.0095,-0.0164,-0.0189,0.0051,0.0532,-0.0422,-0.1184,0.2131,0.0373,0.113,0.1389,0.0679,0.0293,0.0741,-0.0177,0.0638,0.0519,-0.065,-0.0833,-0.0218,-0.0998,-0.0511,-0.0388,-0.0031,-0.0462,0.0179,-0.0345,0.0823,0.0336,0.0747,-0.0099,-0.1023,0.1952,0.012,0.0192,0.0483,0.0456,0.0062,-0.022,-0.1157,0.0817,0.0877,0.0701,0.1346,0.1614,0.0658,-0.0837,-0.0141,0.0053,-0.1203,0.0233,-0.0624,-0.034,0.0484,0.0125,-0.0358,0.1697,-0.0789,0.0565,0.0604,0.2778,0.1857,-0.106,-0.0479,-0.0379,0.0022,-0.0126,0.0395,0,0.0971,-0.1604,-0.0708,0.0365,-0.0155,-0.0448,-0.0042,-0.1087,-0.0634,-0.0059,-0.0941,0.0703,0.0225,0.1284,0.032,-0.1573,-0.1978,0.0631,0.0619,0.02,0.1024,-0.0598,-0.0513,-0.0958,-0.0005,0.1856,0.0479,-0.0608,-0.0786,0.0367,-0.0485,-0.1005,-0.1003,-0.1223,-0.0728,-0.0871,-0.0198,-0.083,-0.108,-0.0108,-0.1535,-0.0525,-0.1192,-0.0551,-0.0236,-0.1139,0.0481,0.0409,-0.1416,0.1274,0.0279,0.0618,0.1096,-0.0421,-0.0197,-0.0622,0.1278,-0.0673,-0.1534,0.1543,-0.0703,-0.0555,-0.1784,0.0554,-0.0442,0.1384,-0.0382,-0.1003,-0.0253,-0.1379,-0.0511,0.0151,0.0404,-0.0972,-0.0828,-0.0923,0.0478,0.0878,-0.1613,-0.1127,-0.0152,-0.0447,-0.2252,-0.0706,-0.0167,-0.0676,0.0939,-0.1745,-0.1976,0.0613,-0.0306,-0.0254,0.1432,0.1035,0.0668,0,-0.0563,-0.044,-0.0895,0.0958,0.0834,0.1018,0.0671,0.0279,0.0661,-0.2759,-0.0953,-0.0281,-0.0375,-0.0438,-0.0639,0.0149,0.04,0.071,-0.0734,0.1158,0.1728,0.1385,-0.1713,-0.0587,-0.0266,0.1317,0.121,-0.0159,0.0142,0.0244,0.0141,-0.0483,-0.1943,0.0481,0.0463,-0.0409,0.0589,0.0867,-0.1402,0.1351,0.0482,0.1156,0.0202,0.0785,0.0255,0.1725,-0.0302,-0.0796,0.0168,0.0524,0.0441,-0.0177,-0.1003,-0.2032,-0.1009,-0.0921,-0.074,-0.0128,0.0533,0.1224,0.0774,-0.0682,0.0006,-0.0383,0.0657,0.1065,-0.0907,-0.0306,0.1072,0.0088,-0.0568,0.1005,-0.0521,-0.0723,0.0961,0.0176,-0.0213,-0.0107,0.0518,-0.0579,-0.0127,0.0543,0.0206,-0.0805,-0.0646,0.2296,-0.1215,0.0776,0.1106,-0.0592,0.0544,0.08,0.0778,0.049,0.027,0,-0.033,-0.0616,-0.0071,-0.0171,0.0971,0.0489,-0.0165,-0.1,-0.0589,-0.1202,0.4113,0.1441,0.0781,-0.0468,0.1291,-0.0682,-0.0276,0.1011,-0.1428,0.0496,0.0692,-0.034,-0.1114,-0.1075,-0.1458,-0.0157,0.0276,0.0911,0.0597,-0.0745,0.0899,-0.0653,0.0746,0.0691,-0.0061,0.0449,0.039,-0.0022,0.0467,0.2252,-0.0722,-0.1003,-0.063,0.0036,-0.0504,-0.0684,-0.0362,-0.163,0.0027,0.0508,-0.0997,-0.1115,-0.0968,0.0135,0.1524,0.0865,0.0586,0.0616,0.0317,0.1471,0.1291,0.0322,-0.1393,0.079],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdDrawRandomCard.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

Its\n`generateRandomCard()` function handles dataset loading, card selection, and\nrendering. This module is used in **Classic Battle** as well as all **Team\nBattle** variants (Female, Male, and Mixed).\n\nCard reveal animations are handled by the `.animate-card` CSS class defined in\n`src/styles/components.css`.

selected, then Card reveal animation plays.\n- If active card set is empty or error occurs: Fallback card (judoka id=0) displayed, then Error message shown if applicable.\n- User can draw again or exit screen.\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- When “Draw Card” is triggered, a random card from the active set is displayed within 300ms.\n- A reveal animation (fade and slide via `.animate-card`) completes within 500ms at ≥60fps.\n- If the random function fails, a fallback card is shown (judoka id=0, from judoka.json).\n- If the active card set is empty, a fallback card is

Top Bar (Persistent Header)\n\n**Contents:**\n\n- **Player Info Module**: “You” + small avatar + status (e.g., “Your Turn” indicator).\n- **Settings Button**: Bigger tappable area (44px+), slight margin from edge, no tiny icons.\n- **Optional Timer** (future feature): If there’s a time limit per draw.\n\n**Why**: Clear identification + quick settings access without hunting for small buttons.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Central Interaction Block (Main Zone)\n\n**Contents:**\n\n- **Card Placeholder Module**:\n  - Start State: “?” icon card.\n  - Draw State: Random card fades and slides in using the `.animate-card` class.\n  - Animation Layer: Reserve transparent zone for slide/fade animations.\n- **Action Button Module**:\n  - Giant “Draw Card!” button (64px height min, 90px optimal for kid-friendly tapping).\n  - **Loading State**: Button changes to a spinner or text (“Drawing…”).\n  - **Error State**: Subtle inline text under the button (“Connection Issue”).\n\n**Why**: Separate content vs. action modules makes touch flow logical and easily adjustable.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Dynamic Feedback (Transitions)\n\n- **Animation Frames**:\n  - Stage 1: Button press triggers card slide transition.\n  - Stage 2: Card fades and slides in using `.animate-card`.\n- **Fallback**:\n  - If fail → fallback card (judoka id=0, from judoka.json) slides in with reduced animation.\n- **Accessibility Setting Check**:\n  - Automatically downgrade if Reduced Motion is detected — immediately snap card reveal, no slide.\n\n**Why**: Players should _feel_ the result without being confused or left staring at nothing.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Modular Expandability\n\n- Add a “Card History” mini panel (expandable from side or bottom).\n- Add mute toggle for sound (little speaker icon on card corner or header).\n- Pre-wire zones for device scaling:\n  - Flexbox/grid layout so the card & button center stack on small screens, side-by-side on tablets.\n\n---","qaContext":"bility**: High contrast placeholders; consider light text on dark backgrounds for error/fallback states.","embedding":[-0.1021,0.0153,-0.0566,0.0554,0,0.1062,0.076,0.0693,0.0845,-0.1013,0.0016,-0.053,-0.0878,0.064,0.0415,0.0476,0.0601,0.0083,-0.0412,0.0291,0.1323,-0.204,0.0376,-0.0239,-0.168,0.1145,-0.0233,-0.0258,-0.0687,-0.0582,-0.03,0.1127,0.1174,0.0074,-0.1153,-0.028,-0.026,0.0482,-0.1588,-0.1321,-0.0854,0.0542,0.0518,-0.0266,0.017,-0.0339,-0.0717,-0.04,-0.0301,0.0841,-0.0016,-0.1167,0.107,-0.0558,0.0284,0.0613,0.0442,-0.0458,0.0227,0.0356,0.0518,0.0094,0.0504,0.0413,-0.0108,0.0319,0.0859,-0.0616,0.0442,-0.0076,-0.0171,-0.0429,0.0321,-0.0472,-0.045,-0.0242,-0.0232,0.0308,-0.0971,-0.0866,0.0064,-0.0807,-0.0095,0.0241,0.0469,-0.0247,0.0391,-0.0124,-0.0617,-0.0134,-0.0686,0.0603,0.0637,-0.0425,0.0838,-0.0179,-0.0587,-0.1411,-0.1487,0.0754,0.0149,-0.0483,0.0782,0.0434,0.082,-0.0429,-0.0083,-0.031,-0.0755,0.0543,-0.0235,-0.0118,-0.0048,-0.0439,0.0575,0.0558,0.0181,0.0429,0.1129,0.0365,0.1806,-0.06,-0.1408,-0.036,0.0306,0.0042,-0.0323,0,0.1012,-0.0906,-0.1651,0.0761,0.0663,-0.0059,0.0657,-0.0753,-0.1128,0.0172,0.0759,0.0795,-0.0498,0.0812,0.0331,-0.1385,-0.0107,0.0867,0.1012,0.0042,0.0339,-0.0039,-0.0464,0.0124,0.0756,0.2886,0.0605,-0.0329,-0.0163,-0.0203,-0.0647,-0.1069,-0.0061,-0.0942,0.0293,-0.0151,-0.0875,-0.0385,0.027,0.0169,-0.1365,-0.092,-0.1261,-0.1485,-0.0473,-0.033,0.1527,0.052,0.0294,0.0954,0.0046,-0.0346,-0.0518,-0.1161,0.0083,-0.1594,0.0067,0.1486,0.0483,0.0284,0.0018,-0.044,-0.0935,-0.0239,-0.0161,0.1197,0.001,-0.1155,0.0264,-0.1485,-0.0793,-0.0135,0.1091,-0.048,-0.0464,-0.0512,-0.0391,-0.0323,-0.1384,-0.0123,-0.1333,-0.0556,-0.0744,-0.0128,-0.0004,-0.0915,0.1294,-0.0535,-0.2375,-0.0099,-0.0785,-0.0669,0.1478,0.0632,0.0215,0,0.0498,-0.0214,-0.0804,0.0852,0.0122,-0.0197,0.1694,0.1752,0.0405,-0.1208,-0.0042,0.1115,-0.0725,-0.059,-0.0544,0.1422,-0.0174,0.0721,-0.0399,0.0567,0.0063,0.1018,-0.1174,0.0187,-0.0923,0.1135,0.1528,-0.0328,0.0343,-0.0954,0.0041,-0.0405,-0.0863,0.1067,0.0167,-0.0571,-0.0045,-0.0369,-0.1225,0.016,0.1055,0.1056,-0.0411,0.0285,-0.0226,0.1056,-0.0051,0.0921,-0.1061,0.0087,-0.0954,-0.1584,-0.0314,-0.0788,-0.088,0.0329,0.1318,0.0011,-0.0012,0.0324,0.0198,-0.1146,0.043,-0.0804,0.0454,0.1175,-0.0162,0.0272,0.0055,0.0509,-0.02,0.083,0.0683,-0.0614,0.0989,0.0053,0.0753,-0.0357,0.07,-0.1424,-0.1255,-0.0333,0.0296,-0.0262,0.0199,0.136,-0.1507,0.0983,0.0662,0.0218,-0.1486,0.078,0.2064,-0.0039,-0.0114,0,-0.088,0.0231,0.0176,-0.073,0.0121,-0.0272,0.0471,-0.0477,-0.0255,-0.0924,0.16,0.0732,-0.0175,-0.0466,0.0238,0.07,-0.043,0.1227,-0.0703,0.005,0.064,-0.073,-0.0025,0.0389,-0.0666,-0.0154,-0.0585,0.1034,0.0683,-0.0366,0.0828,-0.0206,0.1418,0.0401,-0.0298,0.0128,-0.0055,0.0419,0.0868,0.129,0.0117,-0.1298,-0.1274,-0.0483,-0.0226,0.0147,-0.0349,-0.2028,-0.0234,0.1012,-0.0927,-0.0369,-0.0883,0.1237,0.1615,0.0154,0.1315,0.0368,0.0919,0.0645,0.0144,0.065,-0.0568,0.0448],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdDrawRandomCard.md [chunk 6]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdDrawRandomCard.md-chunk-23","text":"## Design and User Experience Considerations\n\n- **Animation Style**: Fade or slide only — no flips or excessive transitions to keep visuals polished.\n- **Sound Effect**: Short celebratory chime or swoosh (<1 second) - future enhancement\n- **Responsiveness**:\n  - Smooth transitions at ≥60fps.\n  - Degrade to static reveal if hardware performance is low.\n- **Accessibility**:\n  - Respect system Reduced Motion settings (disable animations automatically).\n  - Ensure color contrast and text readability on cards (WCAG AA compliance; validate with `npm run check:contrast`).\n- **Default Setting**: Animations and sound OFF unless user/system preferences state otherwise.\n- **Fallback Visuals**:\n  - If card loading fails, show a placeholder/error graphic (judoka id=0, from judoka.json).\n- **Tap Target Size**:\n  - All interactive elements (Draw button) must be ≥44px in height and width, with a recommended 64px for kid-friendly ease. See [UI Design Standards](../codeStandards/codeUIDesignStandards.md#9-accessibility--responsiveness).\n- **Button Size**: Minimum 64px high, 300px wide — central and dominant. Use `--radius-pill` for a capsule shape.\n- **Card Size**: Large enough for excitement, but responsive — 70% of viewport width on mobile, 40% on tablet/desktop.\n- **Spacing**: Tight vertical stacking (~24px between card and button).\n- **Accessibility**: High contrast placeholders; consider light text on dark backgrounds for error/fallback states.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Top Bar (Persistent Header)\n\n**Contents:**\n\n- **Player Info Module**: “You” + small avatar + status (e.g., “Your Turn” indicator).\n- **Settings Button**: Bigger tappable area (44px+), slight margin from edge, no tiny icons.\n- **Optional Timer** (future feature): If there’s a time limit per draw.\n\n**Why**: Clear identification + quick settings access without hunting for small buttons.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

Dynamic Feedback (Transitions)\n\n- **Animation Frames**:\n  - Stage 1: Button press triggers card slide transition.\n  - Stage 2: Card fades and slides in using `.animate-card`.\n- **Fallback**:\n  - If fail → fallback card (judoka id=0, from judoka.json) slides in with reduced animation.\n- **Accessibility Setting Check**:\n  - Automatically downgrade if Reduced Motion is detected — immediately snap card reveal, no slide.\n\n**Why**: Players should _feel_ the result without being confused or left staring at nothing.\n\n---\n\n### 4.

{"id":"prdCountryPickerFilter.md-chunk-1","text":"# PRD: Country Flag Picker Filter\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThis PRD defines a Country Flag Picker Filter for Ju-Do-Kon! that lets players filter Judoka cards by country using an intuitive, accessible flag selector. The goal is to improve user engagement by enabling fast, pride-driven exploration of favorite countries’ athletes (**panel open ≤1 s**), with a performant, responsive, and accessible UI. The picker integrates directly with the Browse Judoka screen and card carousel, supporting both mouse/touch and keyboard navigation.\n\n> Jamal logs into Ju-Do-Kon! after seeing a clip of his country’s top Judoka. He taps the country picker, slides open the panel, and spots his flag among dozens. One tap later, the screen fills with fierce fighters from his homeland. He feels proud — and motivated to start collecting more.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nEach judoka and judoka card is affiliated with a country (e.g., a judoka might be part of the Spanish team). Currently, there is no way for players to browse judoka by country, which frustrates players when searching for their favorite country’s athletes. The lack of an intuitive country filter diminishes user experience, leading to inefficient browsing and potential drop-off.\n\n> By including a country picker, we aim to increase session duration and card interaction rates — both critical, as longer, more engaged sessions correlate directly with higher player retention and in-game activity.\n\nThis issue is timely as our player base is expanding internationally, and regional pride in athletes is becoming a key driver of engagement.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n- **Performance Goal**: Enable country filtering in under 1 second for 90% of sessions.\n- **Reliability Goal**: Achieve zero crashes related to the country selector over 100 sessions.\n- **Coverage Goal**: Ensure >90% of available countries are selectable via the flag interface.\n- **UX Goal**: Achieve a >95% success rate where users select the intended country without mis-taps.\n- Let players easil","qaContext":"PRD: Country Flag Picker Filter --- ## TL;DR This PRD defines a Country Flag Picker Filter for Ju-Do-Kon!","embedding":[0.0007,0.1049,-0.0358,0.0298,0.1679,0.0768,0.2276,-0.0584,0.1028,-0.0328,-0.0299,-0.1623,0.0434,0.1871,0.0651,-0.0229,0.0516,0.0418,-0.1675,0.0526,0.0963,-0.2763,0.0514,-0.0416,-0.1256,-0.0528,0.033,-0.0681,-0.1665,-0.0181,-0.0496,0.1998,0.0163,0.0171,-0.1505,-0.1026,-0.131,0.1016,-0.0762,-0.0713,-0.1018,-0.0536,0.1075,0.0849,-0.0376,-0.0412,0.0237,0.0725,-0.0584,0.0222,-0.0874,0.019,0.0945,-0.0899,0.1279,0.0137,-0.0736,-0.0116,-0.0765,0.1215,-0.0516,-0.0433,-0.0488,0.0028,0.0036,-0.0996,-0.0056,0.0807,-0.0574,0.0825,0.0236,0.0217,-0.088,0.0658,0.0387,0.0449,-0.0669,-0.0068,0.1054,-0.1388,0.0909,0.0238,0.056,-0.0758,0.1021,-0.0806,0.0357,-0.1419,0.0814,0.0089,0.0284,0.1345,0.0916,-0.0081,0.0346,-0.0441,0.0602,0.0913,-0.0852,0.1487,0.0714,-0.0357,0.0541,0.0726,-0.0663,-0.0686,-0.0373,0.1239,-0.0622,0.0746,-0.1124,0.1078,-0.1105,0.0153,-0.1232,0.1431,0.0845,-0.0125,0.1506,0.0547,0.0915,-0.067,-0.106,-0.0317,0.1506,0.0926,-0.0074,0,0.0454,-0.1113,-0.0421,-0.0281,-0.1132,-0.0471,0.0071,-0.1129,-0.1105,0.0135,-0.1072,0.1844,-0.0046,0.1332,0.2408,0.0065,-0.1869,0.0737,-0.0708,0.0399,0.1043,-0.0291,-0.0082,-0.0309,-0.0001,0.1184,-0.0931,-0.0764,-0.0402,0.0596,-0.0461,-0.1055,-0.1121,-0.1063,-0.0963,-0.0546,0.0429,-0.0615,0.0115,0.0565,-0.1212,-0.0532,-0.0158,-0.0107,-0.026,-0.0566,-0.0386,0.0537,-0.087,0.1531,0.049,0.0341,0.0979,-0.1452,0.0482,0.059,0.0544,0.1295,0.0557,0.017,-0.0554,-0.0817,-0.0495,0.0798,0.0759,0.1083,0.0166,0.0148,0.0785,-0.1184,-0.0619,0.0718,0.1035,-0.0211,0.0239,-0.081,0.0102,0.0734,-0.0449,-0.1008,-0.0949,-0.0802,-0.1312,-0.0135,-0.0317,0.1039,0.1142,-0.1779,-0.1595,0.0282,-0.0742,0.1311,-0.0163,0.0083,0.0383,0,0.0279,-0.1603,0.1294,0.1012,0.0943,-0.0401,0.1724,0.0544,-0.007,-0.1724,-0.0373,-0.0675,0.0651,0.0461,-0.0013,0.0538,-0.0612,0.1102,-0.1572,0.1261,0.0999,0.0982,-0.0866,-0.0558,-0.2149,-0.058,0.0131,-0.0897,0.0599,-0.1174,-0.0252,-0.0858,-0.2201,0.0197,-0.0232,-0.0182,-0.121,0.0347,-0.0629,0.3175,-0.0746,-0.0112,-0.1087,0.1106,-0.091,0.0366,-0.0236,0.0161,-0.0785,-0.1463,0.007,0.0455,-0.1379,-0.0423,-0.1282,-0.0584,0.0625,-0.1447,0.0255,0.0464,-0.0755,-0.0608,-0.0155,-0.0516,0.1551,-0.0271,-0.0449,0.1355,0.1258,-0.0166,0.0273,-0.1081,-0.0543,-0.0313,0.1092,0.1588,0.0124,0.0968,0.1064,0.0154,-0.1556,0.0442,-0.0376,-0.1209,0.0765,0.3153,-0.1219,0.0523,0.126,-0.0676,0.0176,0.0583,-0.0191,-0.0281,-0.0617,0,-0.131,-0.0057,-0.032,0.118,-0.0408,0.1122,0.0244,-0.0091,-0.1017,0.0097,0.1977,0.1159,-0.0565,-0.0112,0.0374,0.0326,-0.0012,0.2694,-0.1162,0.1669,0.0411,-0.0174,-0.0345,-0.0245,-0.0653,-0.0173,-0.2099,0.0138,0.0531,-0.0534,0.0741,-0.0466,-0.0161,0.0589,0.0756,0.0961,-0.1008,-0.1478,-0.0755,0.0379,0.0131,-0.1955,-0.0691,0.0125,0.0249,-0.0749,0.003,-0.1339,-0.0267,0.044,-0.1167,-0.1257,-0.0567,-0.0351,0.1483,0.0339,0.0555,-0.0413,0.079,0.1708,0.0979,0.0158,-0.2289,0.0942],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdCountryPickerFilter.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

fails to load, display a generic fallback flag icon.\n- For collections larger than 50 countries, implement virtual scrolling or paging to prevent UI overload.\n- On slow networks, implement graceful degradation with progressive flag loading to prioritize interactivity.\n- If the country list is empty, display a message: \"No countries available.\"\n\n---\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n- Pull available countries dynamically from `judoka.json` to avoid hardcoding.\n- Use image sprite sheets or CDN hosting for flag assets to reduce HTTP requests.\n- Prioritize lazy-loading flag images if >50 countries are available.\n- Fallback flag asset should be a small, lightweight SVG or PNG.\n- Ensure caching headers on flags to minimize repeat loads.\n- Integrate with the card carousel to trigger filtering and update the visible cards.\n- Ensure the panel appears below the persistent top bar and is responsive to different screen sizes.\n- Keyboard navigation and focus management must be implemented for all interactive elements.\n\n---\n\n\n## Dependencies and Integrations\n\n- `judoka.json` data file for country information.\n- Card carousel component which displays filtered judoka

Flag icon.\n  - Country name label beneath the flag.\n- Three display modes:\n  - Hidden: No UI visible until toggled.\n  - Slide-in Panel (default): Narrow vertical panel with scroll.\n  - Full-Screen Grid: Grid layout showing all countries.\n- Mobile Optimization:\n  - Minimum tap target size of 44x44px for flags to ensure touch accessibility (see [UI Design Standards](../codeStandards/codeUIDesignStandards.md#9-accessibility--responsiveness)).\n  - Color contrast ratios must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for readability.\n  - Selected country should be visually highlighted (e.g., border or shading).\n  - Selector should respond well to different screen sizes (responsive design).\n  - The panel must appear below the persistent top bar so the first row of countries is fully visible.\n- Animation Considerations:\n  - Slide-in animation duration: 300ms and respects the user's `prefers-reduced-motion` setting.\n  - Flag grid fade-in duration uses `var(--transition-fast)`.\n- Keyboard navigation:\n  - Tab/Shift+Tab to move between flags and clear filter icon.\n  - Enter/Space to select a flag or clear filter.\n  - Escape to close the panel.\n  - Focus outlines are visible and accessible.\n\n---\n\n### Wireframes\n\n| **Country Picker Mockup 1**                                          |                                          **Country Picker Mockup 2** |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n| ![Country Picker Mockup 1](/design/mockups/mockupCountryPicker1.png) | ![Country Picker Mockup 2](/design/mockups/mockupCountryPicker2.png) |\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] 1.0 Implement Country Flag Picker UI\n  -

{"id":"prdCountryPickerFilter.md-chunk-9","text":"## TL;DR\n\nThis PRD defines a Country Flag Picker Filter for Ju-Do-Kon! that lets players filter Judoka cards by country using an intuitive, accessible flag selector. The goal is to improve user engagement by enabling fast, pride-driven exploration of favorite countries’ athletes (**panel open ≤1 s**), with a performant, responsive, and accessible UI. The picker integrates directly with the Browse Judoka screen and card carousel, supporting both mouse/touch and keyboard navigation.\n\n> Jamal logs into Ju-Do-Kon! after seeing a clip of his country’s top Judoka. He taps the country picker, slides open the panel, and spots his flag among dozens. One tap later, the screen fills with fierce fighters from his homeland. He feels proud — and motivated to start collecting more.\n\n---","qaContext":"TL;DR This PRD defines a Country Flag Picker Filter for Ju-Do-Kon!","embedding":[-0.0714,0.1923,-0.0506,0.0027,0.1306,0.1216,0.2646,-0.1762,0.1597,-0.0837,-0.0042,-0.1094,-0.0223,0.143,-0.0077,0.0317,0.0261,0.0558,-0.088,-0.0512,-0.0081,-0.1794,0.148,-0.0396,-0.1616,0.0752,-0.0162,0.0038,-0.03,-0.0479,0.0127,0.1106,-0.0055,0.0631,-0.1861,-0.0892,-0.0604,0.1317,-0.0268,0.0158,0.0059,-0.0587,0.049,0.0442,0.0329,0.0175,0.022,0.0492,0.0326,-0.0185,-0.0991,-0.015,0.196,-0.0699,0.1495,-0.0555,-0.0956,-0.0525,0.0695,0.0951,0.0009,0.054,-0.0333,0.0743,0.0522,-0.2459,-0.0832,0.141,-0.0247,0.006,0.0478,-0.0063,0.0415,0.0531,-0.0491,-0.0177,-0.0594,0.0075,0.1143,-0.1367,0.0435,-0.0814,0.0141,0.0237,0.045,-0.0039,-0.0534,-0.1266,0.0771,0.0225,0.0503,0.0818,0.1411,-0.058,-0.1527,-0.1202,-0.0435,0.0809,-0.1288,0.2144,0.0785,-0.0484,0.1645,0.0553,-0.0304,-0.139,-0.0715,0.1642,-0.0031,0.0762,-0.0626,0.0876,-0.0684,-0.0005,-0.1132,0.1601,-0.0439,-0.0237,0.0883,0.0084,0.0872,-0.1229,-0.1789,-0.0531,0.1344,0.1519,-0.0815,0,0.1776,-0.1113,0.051,-0.0344,-0.119,-0.1557,0.0358,-0.2228,-0.1331,0.0788,-0.0298,0.1352,-0.0287,0.1784,0.1467,-0.0034,-0.2842,-0.0803,-0.099,-0.0253,0.0567,0.0087,-0.0139,-0.0033,-0.0559,0.1466,-0.0424,-0.0997,0.0265,0.0853,0.0004,-0.1086,-0.0816,-0.06,-0.1611,0.0108,-0.057,-0.0386,-0.0016,0.1245,-0.0313,-0.1274,0.0091,-0.0062,-0.0039,0.0348,-0.09,0.055,0.0491,0.1674,0.083,-0.0901,0.1083,-0.0368,0.0708,0.0224,0.0993,0.1435,0.0575,0.0001,-0.0684,-0.0995,-0.111,0.1447,0.0874,0.0443,0.057,0.0079,0.0425,-0.1004,-0.0623,0.0976,0.0723,0.0513,-0.0215,-0.1428,-0.0073,0.0199,-0.0148,-0.0135,-0.062,-0.0701,-0.0667,0.03,-0.0702,0.1238,0.0739,-0.1813,-0.0883,-0.0011,-0.0903,0.1376,-0.0551,-0.0615,-0.0243,0,0.0547,-0.028,0.1603,0.1751,0.0683,-0.0535,0.164,0.1947,0.0419,-0.0835,-0.0306,-0.0609,0.0972,0.0671,0.0976,0.0202,-0.1388,0.1852,-0.2336,0.0956,0.0876,0.0364,0.0005,0.015,-0.278,-0.0766,0.0732,-0.1174,0.0864,-0.0793,-0.0552,-0.2242,-0.1034,0.1092,0.0467,-0.0328,-0.1228,0.0436,-0.0934,0.2409,-0.1864,-0.015,-0.0885,0.177,-0.0897,0.031,-0.1586,0.0564,-0.1601,-0.2113,-0.0992,0.1077,-0.1282,-0.0611,-0.1212,-0.0192,0.0548,0.0099,0.0214,0.0703,-0.1097,-0.077,-0.002,-0.0977,0.1173,0.0046,-0.0055,0.1129,0.029,-0.103,0.0396,-0.1701,-0.047,-0.0768,0.0792,0.1552,-0.053,0.1987,0.0435,0.063,-0.0859,-0.0525,-0.0462,-0.04,0.2144,0.3726,-0.0694,-0.0416,0.0991,-0.0339,0.0712,0.0782,0.1751,0.0093,-0.1135,0,-0.1582,-0.0705,-0.0204,0.081,-0.0695,0.2425,0.0769,-0.0891,-0.1581,-0.0265,0.1597,0.1462,-0.1338,-0.0181,0.0342,-0.0185,-0.0633,0.2685,-0.0685,0.1058,0.0772,-0.0725,0.096,-0.0013,-0.083,0.0184,-0.2628,0.003,0.0546,-0.0285,0.1159,-0.027,0.0562,0.0438,0.0047,0.1686,-0.1624,-0.1957,-0.0459,0.0294,-0.0577,-0.2556,-0.08,0.0005,-0.0847,0.008,0.0456,-0.1324,-0.0892,-0.0113,-0.111,-0.2019,-0.0576,-0.0853,0.1032,0.0472,0.0905,-0.0775,0.0805,0.1232,0.1256,0.0157,-0.2343,0.0815],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdCountryPickerFilter.md [chunk 9]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdCountryPickerFilter.md-chunk-14","text":"## How It Works\n\nOn in-scope screens (e.g., the Browse Judoka screen), there should be an option to toggle an overlay or slide-in panel that presents all available countries.\n\n**Key Details:**\n\n- Only countries present in the `judoka.json` file will be displayed.\n- Instead of a list, the selector will use flag icons to represent each country.\n- When a user clicks or presses Enter/Space on a flag:\n  - The card carousel refreshes, filtering to display only judoka from the selected country (e.g., clicking Jamaica will filter to only Jamaican judoka).\n- Users can only select one country at a time.\n- A clear filter icon is provided to reset the selection and revert to displaying all judoka.\n- Default display mode when opened is **slide-in panel**.\n- The toggle is represented by a panel icon with an arrow.\n- Countries are displayed in alphabetical order.\n- Each flag button includes alt-text and an `aria-label` (e.g., \"Filter by {country}\") for accessibility.\n- The picker supports keyboard navigation: Tab/Shift+Tab to move between flags, Enter/Space to select, and Escape to close the panel.\n- The panel appears below the persistent top bar so the first row of countries is fully visible.\n- If no judoka exist for a selected country, an empty state message is shown (\"No judoka available for this country\").\n- If a flag asset fails to load, a generic fallback flag icon is displayed.\n- For collections larger than 50 countries, virtual scrolling or paging is implemented to prevent UI overload.\n- Progressive flag loading is used on slow networks to prioritize interactivity.\n\n---\n\n### Flow\n\n1. Player opens the Browse Judoka screen and taps the country selector toggle.\n2. The slide-in panel opens in under one second.\n3.

Flag icon.\n  - Country name label beneath the flag.\n- Three display modes:\n  - Hidden: No UI visible until toggled.\n  - Slide-in Panel (default): Narrow vertical panel with scroll.\n  - Full-Screen Grid: Grid layout showing all countries.\n- Mobile Optimization:\n  - Minimum tap target size of 44x44px for flags to ensure touch accessibility (see [UI Design Standards](../codeStandards/codeUIDesignStandards.md#9-accessibility--responsiveness)).\n  - Color contrast ratios must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for readability.\n  - Selected country should be visually highlighted (e.g., border or shading).\n  - Selector should respond well to different screen sizes (responsive design).\n  - The panel must appear below the persistent top bar so the first row of countries is fully visible.\n- Animation Considerations:\n  -

{"id":"prdClassicBattle.md-chunk-1","text":"# PRD: Classic Battle\n\n---\n\n**Game Mode ID:** `1` (URL: battleJudoka.html)\n\n[Back to Game Modes Overview](prdGameModes.md)\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nClassic Battle is Ju-Do-Kon!’s introductory, head-to-head mode. By offering a fast-paced, low-stakes way for new players to learn stats and game flow (match start ≤5 s after selection), it boosts retention and confidence while maintaining quick matches. This PRD defines how the mode operates, from random draws to scoring and end conditions, ensuring a smooth (**≥60 fps**), accessible, and engaging experience.\n\n> Sora starts a Classic Battle and draws her first card. She confidently taps “Speed,” seeing her stat triumph over the AI’s card. The score ticks up with a satisfying sound. Round after round, she learns which stats matter most. By the end, she feels ready to tackle harder battles — and wants to play again.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nClassic Battle is the main and simplest mode of the game. Without it, new players lack a quick, low-stakes mode to learn stats and grasp the core mechanics. This leads to higher early player drop-off, increased frustration, and fewer repeat sessions because players don’t build mastery or confidence. By providing a fast, engaging way to compare stats (**UI responses <200 ms**), Classic Battle helps new players onboard smoothly and encourages early retention.\n\n> **Player Feedback Example:**  \n> “I tried Ranked Mode first and felt lost — I didn’t know which stat to pick or what the cards meant.” – Playtester, Age 10\n\nThis feedback highlights why Classic Battle is needed now: new players currently face an overwhelming experience without a safe mode to experiment with card stats and turn flow.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n- Deliver a quick head-to-head mode for new players, with average match length ≤3 minutes.\n- Encourage replay through a simple, rewarding scoring system.\n- Increase daily plays by new users by 15%.\n- ≥70% of new players complete a Classic Battle within their first session.\n- Give new players ","qaContext":"PRD: Classic Battle --- **Game Mode ID:** `1` (URL: battleJudoka.","embedding":[-0.0146,0.147,-0.0067,0.0486,0.0481,0.1496,0.06,0.169,0.0237,0.1079,-0.0313,-0.0946,-0.0178,0.0269,0.0607,0.0074,0.0923,0.0377,0.0163,0.1124,0.0411,-0.1562,0.0814,0.0062,-0.0149,0.0482,-0.1022,0.1016,-0.096,-0.1141,-0.0063,0.162,0.1427,-0.0123,-0.2182,-0.0337,-0.0446,0.0762,-0.0958,-0.0667,-0.1265,-0.001,-0.0049,0.0736,0.0009,0.0073,-0.0724,-0.0116,0.0146,-0.0259,-0.0973,-0.0535,0.0023,-0.1077,0.1275,0.1249,0.0247,-0.0062,-0.0209,-0.0143,-0.1011,-0.1387,-0.0493,-0.0238,0.0235,-0.1255,0.0973,0.0706,-0.0256,0.0695,-0.0404,0.1282,-0.1157,-0.0108,0.1141,0.0984,-0.1535,-0.0789,0.0085,-0.0338,-0.0441,0.0259,-0.1119,0.0419,-0.0278,-0.0745,0.122,-0.0032,0.1095,-0.0629,0.0083,0.1825,-0.1017,0.1021,0.147,0.1729,-0.0648,-0.0377,0.0006,0.0902,0.1146,0.0549,0.011,0.0614,0.0935,-0.038,0.0847,-0.0002,-0.0262,-0.0234,-0.0092,-0.084,-0.0505,-0.0157,-0.0124,0.1575,-0.0727,0.1287,0.0067,0.1261,0.1379,-0.1156,-0.0053,0.0087,0.1172,0.0419,0.0414,0,0.1318,-0.121,-0.0623,0.1364,-0.0793,0.0474,0.0742,-0.0416,-0.0219,-0.0277,-0.1365,0.0884,-0.0835,0.0579,0.1035,-0.0399,-0.201,0.047,-0.0476,-0.0002,0.1098,-0.0498,-0.0192,-0.0999,0.0847,0.1481,0.0887,-0.0063,-0.0872,-0.0267,-0.0446,-0.1927,-0.1612,-0.0444,0.0022,0.0363,0.1118,-0.0512,-0.0215,0.0341,-0.174,-0.0015,-0.1065,0.0164,-0.1106,-0.162,-0.0687,0.0213,-0.1185,0.0902,-0.0821,-0.0111,0.033,-0.0463,-0.1326,0.0432,0.039,-0.0199,-0.153,0.0716,0.0737,0.0329,-0.0698,0.1035,-0.0546,0.1258,-0.0637,0.0123,0.0728,-0.0759,-0.0036,0.0048,0.0227,-0.0781,0.0175,-0.0672,0.1168,0.0593,-0.02,-0.1474,0.0489,-0.0077,-0.2626,-0.0018,-0.0857,-0.0266,0.019,-0.1974,-0.111,-0.0071,-0.056,-0.0415,0.0591,0.1394,-0.027,0,-0.0624,-0.068,-0.0011,0.0872,0.156,0.0537,0.0878,-0.0021,0.0243,-0.1189,-0.0946,0.0545,-0.0413,-0.0442,0.0526,-0.0759,-0.0578,0.0658,-0.0007,0.0916,0.1715,0.194,-0.1157,-0.0743,0.0299,-0.0006,0.0338,-0.0377,0.0167,-0.0012,0.2028,-0.0724,-0.1315,0.0214,-0.0071,0.0122,0.0331,0.017,-0.0699,0.2312,0.0806,-0.0104,-0.034,-0.0493,0.0461,0.1175,0.0606,-0.1366,-0.0013,0.0766,0.0191,-0.0173,-0.0515,-0.0844,-0.1497,-0.1638,-0.1242,-0.0248,-0.0951,0.0535,0.1194,-0.0149,-0.1356,0.0981,-0.0203,0.0124,-0.0765,-0.0275,-0.0763,0.0727,-0.2012,0.0565,-0.0483,-0.0462,0.0849,0.0663,-0.165,0.0572,0.0334,0.0011,-0.1104,0.003,-0.0093,-0.0552,-0.0077,0.1949,-0.056,0.0796,0.097,-0.0314,0.063,0.0342,0.0586,0.038,-0.0547,0,-0.0428,-0.0186,-0.0008,0.0553,0.0943,0.0394,-0.1336,-0.0917,-0.0727,0.0219,0.2419,0.0555,-0.0567,-0.1232,0.1002,0.0864,0.0372,0.0656,-0.1057,0.0223,0.0402,-0.0326,-0.1308,-0.1369,-0.0832,-0.0225,0.0656,0.0718,0.0396,-0.0421,0.1656,0.0404,0.0594,-0.0166,0.0772,0.1875,0.1091,0.1028,-0.014,0.109,-0.1331,0.0202,-0.0209,-0.0232,-0.0478,-0.0227,-0.0942,-0.0942,0.0142,-0.1186,0.0817,-0.0558,-0.0833,0.0134,0.0931,0.1888,0.0489,0.0466,-0.0196,0.041,0.074,0.076,-0.0967,0.1102],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdClassicBattle.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdClassicBattle.md-chunk-9","text":"## TL;DR\n\nClassic Battle is Ju-Do-Kon!’s introductory, head-to-head mode. By offering a fast-paced, low-stakes way for new players to learn stats and game flow (match start ≤5 s after selection), it boosts retention and confidence while maintaining quick matches. This PRD defines how the mode operates, from random draws to scoring and end conditions, ensuring a smooth (**≥60 fps**), accessible, and engaging experience.\n\n> Sora starts a Classic Battle and draws her first card. She confidently taps “Speed,” seeing her stat triumph over the AI’s card. The score ticks up with a satisfying sound. Round after round, she learns which stats matter most. By the end, she feels ready to tackle harder battles — and wants to play again.\n\n---","qaContext":"TL;DR Classic Battle is Ju-Do-Kon!","embedding":[-0.0643,0.163,-0.025,0.0157,0.003,0.2345,0.0741,0.0793,0.0958,0.0568,-0.0482,-0.0179,-0.1528,-0.0732,-0.0238,-0.0927,0.1099,0.0276,0.0547,0.1394,0.0413,-0.1084,0.1508,0.0641,-0.0214,0.0591,-0.1354,0.0283,0.0111,-0.179,0.0568,0.2164,0.088,0.0022,-0.2774,-0.0341,0.0267,0.0499,-0.1,0.0767,-0.0173,-0.0529,-0.0854,0.0914,0.0376,-0.0013,-0.0682,-0.0177,0.0214,-0.0726,-0.0686,-0.0098,0.0675,-0.1608,0.0882,0.1061,0.0369,-0.0142,0.0789,0.0152,-0.0546,-0.0629,-0.0332,0.0851,0.1008,-0.2157,0.0854,0.0888,-0.0314,0.0963,0.0046,0.0677,-0.0124,0.0891,0.1207,0.1079,-0.0915,-0.1061,0.0522,-0.0344,-0.0616,-0.0906,-0.1034,0.1244,-0.0811,-0.0704,0.0505,-0.0649,0.1487,-0.1286,-0.0153,0.0699,-0.0456,0.0774,0.0376,0.2081,-0.1148,-0.0357,0.0158,0.1364,0.1371,0.0638,-0.0112,0.0957,0.0813,-0.1246,0.0855,0.0026,0.0294,-0.0187,0.0527,-0.1647,0.0419,-0.058,-0.0065,0.1939,-0.1569,0.1398,0.0015,0.0085,0.0674,-0.1645,-0.0813,0.0153,0.1339,0.0436,-0.028,0,0.174,-0.2046,0.0321,0.0931,-0.0603,0.0531,0.12,-0.1417,-0.0005,0.0225,-0.1617,0.0215,-0.0498,0.0035,0.0521,-0.0749,-0.1449,-0.0229,-0.0747,-0.0232,0.1743,-0.0437,0.0005,-0.068,0.1346,0.1226,0.1138,0.0008,0.0135,0.0221,0.0067,-0.1861,-0.1913,-0.0555,0.0477,0.0991,0.0509,0.02,-0.016,0.1408,-0.1557,-0.015,-0.1172,-0.0263,-0.244,-0.0727,-0.0732,0.1219,-0.1002,0.0601,-0.0855,-0.0674,0.0014,0.0743,-0.0255,0.1336,0.0593,-0.0294,-0.1071,0.1057,0.0561,0.0063,-0.1063,0.152,-0.0486,0.0747,-0.0525,-0.0438,0.0587,-0.1631,-0.0258,0.0887,-0.0609,-0.0522,-0.014,0.0084,0.113,0.0831,0.0306,-0.0868,0.0174,0.0165,-0.2164,0.0345,0.0008,-0.0597,0.0012,-0.2824,-0.1039,0.0307,0.0638,-0.0671,0.087,0.0326,-0.1655,0,-0.016,-0.0593,-0.0071,0.1702,0.2081,0.089,0.0962,0.0753,0.0337,-0.0409,-0.0386,-0.0347,0.0017,-0.0971,0.1431,-0.1379,0.0243,0.027,0.0297,0.0696,0.1934,0.01,-0.0537,-0.0721,0.046,-0.0064,0.0482,-0.047,-0.1046,0.0379,0.1623,-0.1565,-0.1763,-0.0016,-0.032,0.0718,-0.007,0.0537,-0.0747,0.1148,0.0164,-0.0967,0.025,0.0655,0.0752,0.0865,-0.0663,-0.0294,-0.0009,0.0438,-0.0048,0.003,-0.0599,-0.0557,-0.1053,-0.176,-0.0803,0.0432,-0.1925,0.0683,0.1796,-0.1151,-0.1359,0.0558,-0.0655,-0.0285,-0.0604,-0.1274,-0.0509,-0.0717,-0.1006,0.0089,-0.1891,0.0152,-0.042,0.0395,-0.1819,0.0246,0.1113,0.1019,-0.1838,-0.023,-0.0216,-0.0028,0.1048,0.2547,-0.0278,0.0975,0.1409,0.0163,0.1114,0.0101,0.1264,0.0354,-0.0809,0,-0.1146,-0.0786,0.0554,0.0544,0.0709,0.0712,-0.0523,-0.1201,-0.0897,-0.0324,0.2535,0.0985,-0.0086,-0.1083,0.1695,0.0664,0.024,0.1187,-0.0878,-0.0312,0.0335,-0.0944,-0.0648,-0.1492,-0.0285,0.0324,0.0207,0.1621,0.0954,-0.1259,0.1149,0.0291,0.0818,-0.0024,0.0231,0.1908,0.0686,0.1195,0.0926,0.1152,-0.204,-0.0331,0.0045,0.0413,-0.0815,-0.0197,0.0219,-0.0563,-0.0219,-0.2396,0.0711,-0.075,-0.0491,0.0237,0.1002,0.1838,0.0379,-0.0023,-0.1042,0.1474,-0.0105,-0.003,-0.0904,0.0596],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdClassicBattle.md [chunk 9]","tags":["prd","design-doc","how"],"version":1},
{"id":"prdClassicBattle.md-chunk-10","text":"## Problem Statement\n\nClassic Battle is the main and simplest mode of the game. Without it, new players lack a quick, low-stakes mode to learn stats and grasp the core mechanics. This leads to higher early player drop-off, increased frustration, and fewer repeat sessions because players don’t build mastery or confidence. By providing a fast, engaging way to compare stats (**UI responses <200 ms**), Classic Battle helps new players onboard smoothly and encourages early retention.\n\n> **Player Feedback Example:**  \n> “I tried Ranked Mode first and felt lost — I didn’t know which stat to pick or what the cards meant.” – Playtester, Age 10\n\nThis feedback highlights why Classic Battle is needed now: new players currently face an overwhelming experience without a safe mode to experiment with card stats and turn flow.\n\n---","qaContext":"Problem Statement Classic Battle is the main and simplest mode of the game.","embedding":[0.0126,0.1677,0.0651,0.0909,0.053,0.1946,-0.0214,0.16,-0.1534,0.0592,-0.0633,-0.0251,-0.0107,0.0539,0.0679,-0.0211,0.0967,-0.0822,0.1501,0.1025,-0.113,-0.0852,0.0262,0.1006,0.0187,0.0657,-0.1418,0.1781,0.0042,-0.0306,-0.0207,0.1578,0.201,0.0031,-0.2324,-0.1505,0.0158,0.0502,-0.0768,-0.0396,-0.0926,0.0003,0.0164,0.0406,-0.0378,-0.0188,-0.0394,-0.084,0.0862,0.0249,-0.0307,-0.0641,0.1393,-0.1821,0.1874,0.092,-0.0413,-0.026,0.0064,0.0699,-0.1081,-0.1567,-0.0073,-0.021,-0.008,-0.0779,0.1129,0.1228,-0.05,0.0005,-0.0795,0.1038,-0.0741,0.0196,0.1304,0.1335,-0.3236,-0.0829,0.053,-0.0105,-0.0489,-0.0854,-0.0996,0.0913,-0.0044,0.0295,0.1108,-0.0935,0.003,-0.0759,0.0742,0.1117,-0.0212,0.1334,0.0846,0.1578,-0.0398,-0.0295,-0.0158,0.0547,0.1428,-0.0089,0.0682,0.079,0.1163,-0.0773,0.1777,-0.004,-0.0534,-0.0098,0.0174,-0.0699,-0.0665,-0.0667,-0.0179,0.0383,-0.0463,0.0848,-0.069,0.1626,0.0731,-0.1108,-0.0508,0.0136,0.1472,0.1596,0.0849,0,0.1522,-0.1127,-0.0541,0.2043,-0.1446,0.0925,0.0785,-0.0405,0.0177,-0.0591,-0.0504,0.1732,-0.0317,0.039,0.0863,-0.0138,-0.2127,-0.0499,-0.0124,-0.0603,0.0454,-0.0316,0.0136,-0.1181,0.0063,0.1374,0.1108,-0.0259,0.0005,-0.0268,-0.0312,-0.2234,-0.1411,0.0388,-0.0072,0.082,0.1584,-0.0687,-0.0004,0.0507,-0.158,0.0473,-0.1966,-0.0161,-0.0193,-0.0205,-0.02,0.0111,-0.1195,0.04,-0.1662,0.0387,0.0113,-0.0287,-0.0933,-0.0263,-0.0463,-0.0674,-0.1486,-0.0283,0.0399,0.0733,-0.0369,0.0703,-0.0973,0.0845,-0.0093,0.0082,-0.1103,0.001,0.1558,-0.1024,-0.1021,-0.0669,0.0782,-0.0316,0.1995,0.0312,0.0201,-0.1847,0.0565,-0.0645,-0.1184,0.0448,-0.0561,-0.0322,0.054,-0.1866,-0.0305,0.0345,-0.0222,-0.0531,0.051,0.1917,-0.0435,0,-0.0087,-0.0104,0.0799,0.022,0.1321,0.0237,0.0755,-0.0136,0.0591,-0.0268,0.0034,0.1054,-0.0509,-0.0451,0.0118,-0.1313,-0.116,0.0657,0.0054,0.0639,0.2115,0.0951,-0.0994,-0.1082,0.0339,-0.0157,-0.008,-0.0743,-0.008,-0.0755,0.2141,-0.0808,0.0204,0.0001,0.0427,0.077,0.017,0.0452,-0.0959,0.1218,-0.0435,-0.0176,-0.055,-0.1221,0.0663,0.1985,0.0411,-0.1539,-0.0193,0.047,-0.0081,0.0005,-0.063,-0.1004,-0.2006,-0.1579,-0.1166,-0.0096,-0.1853,0.1001,0.0753,-0.0178,-0.1097,0.0386,-0.066,0.0549,-0.0554,-0.0043,-0.1524,0.0873,-0.1825,-0.0061,-0.0877,-0.0402,0.0286,0.0937,-0.1398,0.0745,-0.0106,-0.0019,0.0529,0.0082,-0.0421,-0.0838,-0.0347,0.2,-0.0162,0.0609,0.0329,0.0377,0.0323,-0.0974,-0.007,0.0372,-0.0606,0,-0.0631,-0.0091,0.0143,0.0325,0.033,-0.0074,-0.135,-0.0462,0.0266,0.1365,0.1035,-0.0099,-0.0541,-0.1086,0.0962,0.1292,-0.0528,-0.0839,-0.0431,0.0155,-0.0039,-0.0492,-0.0198,-0.0877,-0.0371,0.0196,0.0577,0.0471,0.0345,0.0129,0.1315,0.0916,0.0312,0.013,0.0427,0.2327,0.0304,0.1175,-0.0421,0.0184,-0.1928,-0.0305,-0.0742,-0.0054,-0.0948,-0.0098,-0.0894,-0.0104,-0.014,-0.1879,0.1345,-0.0521,-0.0006,0.0438,0.0703,0.227,0.0894,0.0657,0.0074,-0.0783,0.1284,0.0318,-0.1084,0.095],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdClassicBattle.md [chunk 10]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

The CSS rule `#stat-buttons button { -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; }` combined with a reflow ensures Safari clears the red touch overlay.\n- If the Judoka dataset fails to load, an error message appears with option to reload.\n- **All Info Bar content (messages, timer, score) must meet accessibility and responsiveness requirements as described in prdBattleInfoBar.md.**\n\n---","qaContext":"Acceptance Criteria - Cards are revealed in the correct sequence each round.","embedding":[-0.0832,0.0784,-0.1259,0.0038,0.0804,0.1103,0.1343,0.0641,0.1609,0.0193,0.0079,-0.1001,0.0374,0.0351,0.0268,-0.0338,0.036,-0.0286,-0.0355,0.0614,0.0766,-0.0783,0.0304,-0.0355,-0.0976,0.0512,-0.0333,0.0127,-0.0644,-0.1069,-0.0195,0.0523,0.1921,-0.0181,-0.123,-0.0594,-0.1042,0.0001,-0.122,-0.0148,-0.0968,-0.045,0.0133,0.0675,0.1124,0.0247,-0.1096,0.0037,-0.0377,0.0626,-0.1385,-0.0102,0.0886,0.0226,0.0941,0.0868,0.0458,-0.0157,-0.0237,0.0088,0.0399,-0.1123,-0.0864,0.0794,0.0785,0.0074,0.0486,-0.0367,0.0424,0.0459,-0.055,0.0599,-0.0477,-0.0339,0.0332,0.0616,-0.0879,-0.0659,0.0056,-0.0768,-0.0828,-0.1135,0.008,0.0364,0.1498,-0.0132,0.117,0.0392,0.0757,0.0336,-0.003,0.1068,-0.0142,0.0698,0.0406,0.0806,-0.1019,-0.0608,0.0004,0.0959,-0.0002,-0.0136,0.017,-0.0163,0.0437,-0.0482,0.0761,0.0543,0.0066,0.0298,0,0.0074,0.0533,0.0398,-0.0197,0.1682,-0.0908,0.0584,0.021,0.0266,0.0859,0.0135,-0.1061,-0.0819,0.0951,0.0609,0.0096,0,0.0185,-0.1934,-0.0751,0.0608,-0.0143,-0.0076,-0.0884,-0.1246,-0.0088,0.0706,-0.0394,0.0485,-0.0719,-0.0334,0.0709,-0.0679,-0.0076,0.1295,-0.0732,0.0529,0.1453,0.0027,-0.0528,-0.096,0.0723,0.2872,0.0418,-0.0411,-0.0042,0.0143,-0.0074,-0.1474,-0.1002,0.0012,0.0104,-0.0532,-0.0017,-0.0231,-0.0134,0.0656,-0.1912,-0.0553,-0.109,-0.0673,-0.0446,-0.1153,-0.0062,0.0461,0.0242,0.1587,-0.0355,0.0395,0.0447,-0.0723,-0.0148,-0.026,-0.0115,0.0901,-0.0671,0.0959,0.0081,-0.0237,-0.1103,-0.0409,-0.0435,0.1156,-0.0424,-0.0651,0.0766,-0.0439,-0.0855,0.03,0.0649,0.0215,-0.0172,-0.0855,-0.0021,0.0219,-0.1208,-0.0495,-0.0921,-0.0132,-0.189,0.0055,0.0138,0.0546,0.0374,-0.0637,-0.1889,0.0236,0.0075,0.0338,0.0146,0.1366,-0.0161,0,-0.0545,-0.0307,-0.028,0.1063,0.0794,-0.0069,0.0885,0.1135,0.1097,-0.1734,0.0434,0.0399,-0.1178,-0.0134,-0.0589,0.0626,-0.0559,0.0311,-0.1273,0.1207,0.1293,0.0313,-0.1191,-0.0273,-0.0851,0.0787,0.118,-0.0119,0.0294,-0.0623,0.0749,-0.0682,-0.1841,0.114,0.0244,-0.0644,0.0495,-0.0294,-0.085,0.225,0.15,0.0431,-0.1292,0.0357,-0.014,0.1558,0.0359,-0.0889,-0.0308,-0.1222,0.0342,-0.0291,-0.0184,-0.0131,-0.1247,-0.0715,-0.0659,-0.0703,-0.0589,0.1163,0.0129,-0.0141,-0.0038,-0.051,0.0719,0.1181,-0.034,0.0232,0.0303,0.0405,-0.0352,0.0417,-0.0101,-0.0606,0.0764,0.0789,-0.1217,-0.0686,0.0206,-0.013,-0.0792,-0.008,0.0295,-0.0474,0.0002,0.1939,-0.0228,0.0219,0.107,0.0078,-0.0501,0.1097,0.1561,0.1002,-0.115,0,-0.0994,-0.044,0.0417,0.0051,0.028,0.0724,-0.0398,-0.0743,-0.0675,-0.0907,0.1672,0.119,-0.044,-0.0802,0.0224,0.0035,-0.0478,0.0967,-0.039,-0.0534,0.0318,-0.1168,-0.0568,-0.0137,-0.1154,-0.0028,-0.0334,0.0589,-0.0261,-0.0064,0.0746,-0.0229,0.0862,0.024,-0.0309,0.0671,0.0485,-0.0148,0.0783,0.0388,-0.0083,-0.0899,-0.077,-0.0124,-0.0082,-0.0365,-0.04,-0.173,0.0223,-0.0911,0.0491,-0.1117,-0.1209,0.0687,0.1493,0.0925,0.1184,-0.0776,-0.0217,0.0469,0.0735,0.0497,-0.0382,-0.0216],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdClassicBattle.md [chunk 19]","tags":["prd","design-doc","how"],"version":1},

When disabled, the button should remain visible using the `--button-disabled-bg` token.\n  - Ensure player and opponent cards show all stats without scrolling on common desktop resolutions (e.g., 1440px width).\n  - Provide a dedicated \"Quit Match\" button below the controls.\n    Clicking it opens a confirmation modal styled like the\n    **Restore Defaults** dialog from the Settings page.\n  - A small help icon (`#stat-help`) next to the stat buttons displays a tooltip\n    explaining how to pick an attribute. The tooltip auto-opens once on first\n    visit using `localStorage` to remember the dismissal.\n  - Tooltips on stat names, country flags, weight indicators, and navigation icons provide accessible explanations.\n  - **Accessibility:**\n  - Minimum text contrast ratio: ≥4.5:1 (per WCAG).\n  - Minimum touch target size: ≥44px.

{"id":"prdChangeLog.md-chunk-1","text":"# PRD: Recent Judoka Updates Log\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThe Recent Judoka Updates Log provides players and developers with a fast, accessible way to view the 20 most recently updated Judoka cards. This feature increases transparency around balance changes and supports both QA and player engagement by surfacing recent modifications directly in the UI. The log is accessible from the Settings menu and displays a responsive, simplified table sourced from `judoka.json`.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Statement / Why It Matters\n\nPlayers and developers currently lack a simple, in-game method to see which Judoka cards have been updated. This makes it difficult to track balance changes, test recent modifications, or understand why a favorite character may perform differently. Relying on code diffs or external communication is inefficient and excludes non-technical users.\n\n---\n\n## Goals / Success Metrics\n\n- Allow players and developers to view the 20 most recently updated Judoka cards.\n- Page loads fully in under 2 seconds on mid-tier tablets with 2GB RAM over a 3G mobile network.\n- Improve visibility into Judoka rebalances without requiring developer tools or card-by-card comparisons.\n- Maintain global UI consistency: header, footer, fonts, and background style.\n\n---\n\n## User Stories\n\n- As a player, I want to see which Judoka cards were recently updated so I can understand balance changes.\n- As a developer, I want to quickly verify that recent Judoka edits are reflected in the game UI.\n- As a QA tester, I want to confirm that the most recently modified cards are displayed correctly and sorted as expected.\n\n---\n\n## Prioritized Functional Requirements\n\n| Priority | Feature                  | Description                                                             |\n| :------: | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|  **P1**  | Load and Parse Data      | Extract Judoka entries from `judoka.json`, including required fields.   |\n|  **P1**  | S","qaContext":"PRD: Recent Judoka Updates Log ## TL;DR The Recent Judoka Updates Log provides players and developers with a fast, accessible way to view the 20 most recentl...","embedding":[-0.0627,0.1527,-0.0778,0.0059,-0.0047,0.0484,0.029,0.052,0.0758,0.0182,-0.0132,-0.1069,0.0207,0.0809,0.001,-0.0205,0.0163,0.0853,-0.1812,-0.0851,0.0002,-0.0642,0.0668,0.0413,0.0217,0.117,-0.0476,0.0426,-0.1307,-0.0616,-0.1314,0.1335,0.1077,0.1121,-0.0434,-0.0786,-0.094,0.0429,0.0584,-0.0827,-0.1465,0.0008,-0.022,0.0461,0.0856,-0.0493,-0.1285,-0.0006,-0.0855,0.0638,-0.1831,0.0248,0.0168,0.0354,0.098,0.0034,0.072,-0.0536,-0.0677,0.0417,0.0036,0.003,-0.0233,0.0691,-0.0805,-0.1019,0.052,0.0839,0.0606,0.0177,-0.0611,0.0879,-0.0342,-0.1015,-0.0892,0.0908,-0.0421,0.0049,-0.0825,-0.1844,-0.0543,-0.0814,-0.008,0.0817,0.1435,-0.039,0.0855,-0.0073,-0.0383,0.0202,0.0354,0.0898,0.1599,0.0178,0.0019,0.0676,0.0281,-0.0555,-0.0351,0.1921,-0.0565,0.0352,0.1272,0.0413,0.0103,-0.0068,0.1053,0.0332,-0.0398,0.0042,0.027,0.0821,-0.164,-0.063,0.0135,0.1111,0.0783,0.0514,-0.0286,0.1488,0.177,-0.0438,-0.0623,0.0413,0.1146,0.1032,0.0148,0,0.1236,-0.112,0.0071,-0.0298,-0.0698,-0.0114,-0.0078,-0.1236,-0.058,-0.0071,-0.0046,0.2883,-0.1146,0.0442,0.0608,-0.0576,-0.173,0.1002,-0.0506,0.1007,0.0798,-0.108,-0.0554,-0.1063,0.0925,0.1287,0.0403,-0.0341,-0.1057,0.031,0.0025,-0.1825,-0.0674,-0.0953,-0.0169,-0.055,-0.0037,-0.1082,0.0418,0.0151,-0.0476,-0.034,-0.1154,-0.2082,-0.0224,-0.0635,-0.1194,0.0685,-0.0133,-0.0391,0.0537,0.082,-0.0018,-0.0626,-0.0359,-0.1341,0.0822,0.0265,0.0732,0.1136,-0.0091,0.0064,-0.0838,0.0626,0.0099,0.0768,-0.0007,0.0217,0.0441,0.0171,-0.1051,0.0364,0.0815,-0.0312,-0.0203,-0.1022,-0.0442,0.1005,-0.135,-0.0644,0.0828,0.0097,-0.0943,0.0343,-0.0402,0.0242,0.1161,-0.0476,-0.2265,0.0465,-0.0391,0.0835,0.0582,-0.0205,0.0541,0,-0.0073,0.0154,0.078,0.0602,0.1105,-0.1559,-0.0037,0.092,0.0499,-0.1114,0.0003,-0.085,-0.164,-0.0799,-0.0218,0.1184,-0.0447,0.0071,-0.0985,0.077,0.0705,0.2237,-0.0137,0.0145,-0.1134,0.0089,0.0975,-0.0248,-0.082,-0.1572,-0.0258,-0.1703,-0.1767,-0.0157,-0.0063,-0.1282,-0.0087,-0.0236,-0.0169,0.3188,0.1193,0.069,-0.1252,0.0876,-0.033,0.0427,-0.0668,0.0075,-0.0429,-0.1039,0.0337,0.0004,-0.0637,-0.0535,-0.0445,-0.056,0.049,-0.064,-0.0388,0.0321,-0.1235,0.0044,0.0336,-0.0688,0.1129,0.0182,-0.045,-0.0741,-0.0379,-0.0304,-0.0889,-0.0769,-0.0229,0.0242,0.0803,0.0832,-0.0658,0.0001,0.1334,-0.0136,-0.0865,0.0032,0.0418,-0.0446,0.016,0.1537,-0.0869,0.0084,0.0564,-0.033,-0.0587,0.0035,0.1173,0.0192,-0.0301,0,-0.1395,-0.0879,-0.0879,0.12,0.0649,0.0574,-0.0636,0.0252,0.007,-0.144,0.2414,0.1438,-0.1084,-0.0467,0.0367,0.0139,-0.0502,0.0218,-0.1188,-0.0195,0.0558,0.0688,0.0338,0.0016,-0.0547,-0.067,-0.1256,0.0372,0.0408,-0.0179,0.1816,-0.0357,0.054,-0.0061,0.0867,0.0388,0.0921,-0.013,-0.0334,0.1252,-0.0479,-0.1508,-0.1227,0.0213,0.0627,-0.115,-0.1008,-0.2066,0.0056,-0.187,-0.0274,-0.2114,0.0503,0.0327,-0.0226,0.1042,0.1464,0.0154,0.1372,-0.0334,0.1292,-0.0504,-0.0304,0.1328],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdChangeLog.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

Slice the results to the most recent 20.\n- Build rows using DOM methods to avoid innerHTML injection. Each row includes\n  Judoka ID, card code, portrait (48×48 px), formatted date, and full name.\n- Portrait images use a fallback source (`judokaPortrait-0.png`) when loading\n  fails, with alt text like \"Portrait of Judoka Kano\".\n- The page follows existing layout conventions: header, `.home-screen` wrapper,\n  and bottom navigation bar. Include a spinner during loading and a friendly\n  message if no data is available.\n- Table rows alternate between `--color-surface` and `--color-tertiary` to\n  create zebra striping.","qaContext":"2** Include columns: Judoka ID, Card Code, Portrait, Last Modified, Name - [x] **1.","embedding":[-0.0921,0.1397,0.0055,0.0357,0.0184,-0.0057,-0.0216,0.0047,0.0363,-0.0446,0.0185,-0.0477,0.1209,-0.0326,0.0118,-0.0219,-0.0751,0.0393,-0.1072,0.015,-0.0495,-0.0641,0.0423,-0.0622,0.0048,0.2183,-0.0016,0.03,-0.161,-0.1139,-0.0039,0.094,-0.0545,0.0572,0.0111,-0.0118,-0.1504,0.0314,0.0233,-0.0039,-0.1876,0.0085,0.0505,0.0415,0.0761,-0.0844,-0.2183,-0.107,0.0073,0.0458,-0.2145,-0.0186,-0.0099,0.0089,0.0556,0.0141,-0.0358,-0.0198,-0.0161,0.1128,0.0703,0.0174,0.0445,0.0408,0.0223,-0.1744,-0.0317,-0.0261,0.0615,0.0774,0.0062,0.0131,-0.0187,-0.0565,-0.134,-0.0728,-0.0481,-0.0584,-0.0286,-0.1328,-0.0341,-0.0573,-0.0634,0.0877,0.0358,0.0086,0.0146,0.0856,-0.045,-0.0479,-0.0486,0.0315,0.1091,0.0792,-0.038,0.1034,0.0771,-0.0637,-0.0692,0.1821,-0.0414,-0.0036,0.0803,0.1637,0.1051,-0.0545,0.0938,-0.0127,-0.0504,-0.0104,-0.0253,0.103,-0.1604,-0.0443,-0.0486,0.0217,0.0992,-0.039,0.0218,0.1383,0.2516,-0.0218,-0.0565,-0.0478,0.113,0.0049,0.078,0,0.0688,-0.1344,0.0493,-0.0056,0.0537,-0.0767,0.0148,-0.0595,-0.0738,0.0516,0.0021,0.1454,-0.1572,0.0685,0.0301,-0.019,-0.0181,0.0904,0.012,0.0904,0.0903,-0.1508,-0.025,0.0242,-0.0344,0.1361,0.0124,0.0606,-0.0894,-0.0141,0.0256,-0.115,-0.1027,-0.0677,0.0304,-0.0669,-0.0085,-0.0567,-0.0476,0.0842,-0.0316,0.0238,-0.101,-0.1589,0.0035,-0.0181,0.0038,0.0209,0.0442,0.0071,-0.1086,0.0212,0.0522,0.0043,-0.0701,-0.0869,-0.0353,0.0083,0.074,0.0771,0.0313,-0.056,-0.132,0.0147,0.0341,-0.0364,0.0633,-0.0333,-0.0351,0.0137,0.0278,-0.0206,0.2314,-0.0339,0.0547,-0.099,-0.0369,0.0298,-0.1654,-0.0882,0.1175,-0.0068,-0.1047,-0.0544,0.0559,0.1157,0.1372,-0.0915,-0.1748,0.0679,-0.0728,0.0436,-0.0124,-0.1382,-0.0332,0,0.0672,0.0049,-0.0174,0.0441,0.152,-0.05,0.0244,0.2081,0.0624,-0.102,0.0272,-0.0037,-0.0672,-0.0949,-0.0207,0.2284,-0.0085,-0.1107,-0.1579,0.0453,-0.0047,0.2478,-0.0783,0.0243,-0.0183,0.0196,0.1352,0.0468,-0.0961,-0.0443,-0.0164,-0.0928,-0.1256,0.1159,0.0579,-0.0842,-0.0503,0.0349,-0.0953,0.1937,0.0322,0.0183,-0.0996,0.0899,0.0854,-0.0197,-0.0446,0.1494,0.0406,-0.0484,0.015,-0.1148,-0.1068,-0.0889,0.0374,-0.0604,0.0452,-0.0126,-0.074,0.0455,-0.0582,-0.08,0.0686,-0.1093,0.0798,-0.0044,-0.1548,-0.0454,-0.0441,0.0394,-0.176,-0.0216,0.1089,-0.001,0.0661,0.0749,-0.006,0.0187,0.134,-0.0376,-0.1117,0.0433,0.0316,-0.0688,0.0581,0.1434,-0.1329,0.0564,0.0186,-0.0888,-0.0371,-0.0361,0.1419,0.0344,-0.0376,0,-0.0413,-0.1073,-0.0969,0.0221,-0.0357,0.018,0.1018,-0.0631,0.0984,-0.1037,0.2797,0.1589,0.0123,0.0935,-0.0958,0.0258,0.0329,0.1384,-0.1205,-0.039,0.0292,0.0008,-0.0009,-0.0744,0.0529,0.0015,-0.1155,-0.0212,0.0104,-0.0292,0.0464,-0.0439,0.0757,-0.013,0.0597,-0.0546,0.0878,-0.0535,-0.0715,0.053,0.0225,-0.0504,-0.0646,-0.0572,0.0763,-0.0176,-0.0094,-0.1104,0.0787,-0.1219,-0.0193,-0.1743,0.0041,-0.0659,0.0747,0.0633,0.1738,0.0634,0.1032,-0.0136,0.0778,-0.0416,0.0373,0.0727],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdChangeLog.md [chunk 4]","tags":["prd","design-doc","what"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdChangeLog.md-chunk-22","text":"## Implementation Notes\n\n- Create `src/helpers/changeLogPage.js` to load `judoka.json` via `fetchJson` and\n  populate the table on DOM ready.\n- Sort entries by the `lastUpdated` field (desc) and fallback to name when dates\n  match. Slice the results to the most recent 20.\n- Build rows using DOM methods to avoid innerHTML injection. Each row includes\n  Judoka ID, card code, portrait (48×48 px), formatted date, and full name.\n- Portrait images use a fallback source (`judokaPortrait-0.png`) when loading\n  fails, with alt text like \"Portrait of Judoka Kano\".\n- The page follows existing layout conventions: header, `.home-screen` wrapper,\n  and bottom navigation bar. Include a spinner during loading and a friendly\n  message if no data is available.\n- Table rows alternate between `--color-surface` and `--color-tertiary` to\n  create zebra striping.","qaContext":"Implementation Notes - Create `src/helpers/changeLogPage.","embedding":[-0.1773,0.1126,-0.0184,0.0701,-0.0602,0.0548,-0.0097,0.0014,0.0879,-0.0767,0.0688,0.0098,0.1238,0.0726,-0.0232,0.0118,-0.0606,0.0979,-0.054,0.0341,-0.066,-0.1146,0.12,-0.0154,0.0433,0.1911,0.0367,0.0145,-0.0336,-0.127,0.0116,0.0315,-0.0111,-0.0254,0.0251,0.0373,-0.1382,0.065,0.0947,0.0791,-0.144,-0.0507,0.047,0.0592,0.1488,-0.0374,-0.0814,-0.0809,0.0637,0.0419,-0.2092,-0.0521,0.0246,-0.0373,0.129,0.0017,-0.013,-0.0083,0.018,0.105,0.038,0.0788,0.0199,0.0584,0.0142,-0.1719,-0.0488,0.1035,-0.0297,0.0958,0.0078,0.0023,0.0278,-0.0188,-0.0968,-0.0513,0.0117,0.0347,0.0216,-0.1641,0.011,-0.0869,0.0469,0.1178,0.1468,0.1207,0.1187,-0.029,0.0016,0.0454,0.0056,0.0018,0.1272,0.0502,-0.1155,0.064,0.0324,0.0199,-0.1066,0.1701,-0.0493,-0.0451,0.1605,0.1385,0.0567,-0.092,0.0546,0.1109,0.0198,-0.043,-0.0522,0.1216,-0.1923,-0.0877,-0.1027,0.0068,0.0711,-0.1638,0.016,0.0431,0.1832,0.0345,-0.0923,-0.0174,0.1109,0.0505,0.0417,0,0.1252,-0.0851,0.0496,0.0554,-0.0121,-0.065,-0.1017,-0.1392,-0.1665,0.0887,0.0437,0.0344,-0.1494,0.0954,-0.0102,0.0294,-0.1081,-0.0028,0.0031,0.0526,0.0342,-0.057,-0.0397,0.0112,-0.1142,0.2034,0.0407,0.0318,-0.1279,0.0487,0.0323,-0.1596,-0.1551,-0.0692,-0.0126,-0.0143,0.0517,-0.083,-0.0893,0.1539,-0.0132,-0.0092,-0.1656,-0.0871,0.0598,-0.0057,0.0154,0.0464,0.0801,0.0248,-0.1437,0.0934,0.1392,0.0731,-0.0701,-0.0685,-0.0295,-0.0092,0.0733,0.0058,0.0641,-0.057,-0.1811,0.0536,0.0389,-0.0701,-0.0031,-0.0284,-0.0147,-0.0619,0.0091,0.0129,0.1835,0.0023,-0.0386,-0.1037,-0.1003,-0.0186,-0.0895,0.0295,0.105,0.0243,-0.0831,-0.0251,0.0492,0.1396,0.1304,-0.0885,-0.0921,0.1285,0.0082,0.0302,-0.0326,-0.075,-0.01,0,0.0659,0.0595,-0.0521,0.0757,0.0493,-0.0502,0.0591,0.307,0.0747,-0.0878,0.1193,-0.0317,-0.1328,-0.0828,-0.0321,0.1328,-0.051,-0.0004,-0.2138,0.0084,0.1055,0.1755,-0.0367,0.0479,-0.0818,0.0666,0.2034,0.0681,-0.1399,0.0507,-0.0717,-0.1807,-0.0634,0.154,-0.0025,-0.0034,-0.0779,0.0002,-0.0539,0.1675,0.0023,-0.0013,-0.1049,0.1002,0.0026,-0.0316,-0.1234,0.1172,0.1154,-0.1021,-0.0232,-0.1656,-0.0081,-0.118,0.0128,-0.1512,0.0802,-0.052,-0.0258,0.2043,-0.1211,0.0312,0.0716,-0.1636,-0.013,-0.0309,-0.1366,0.0417,-0.0385,-0.0867,-0.1177,-0.0423,0.1069,-0.05,0.0603,-0.0192,-0.0125,0.0955,0.1034,-0.0924,-0.0623,0.0017,-0.0262,-0.1364,0.1404,0.1451,-0.1601,0.0549,0.0005,-0.1075,-0.0275,0.015,0.1521,0.1524,-0.0408,0,-0.1639,-0.084,-0.0497,0.0121,-0.0219,0.0193,0.038,-0.098,0.0114,-0.1084,0.2722,0.2368,-0.0419,0.0899,-0.0992,-0.0368,-0.0129,0.1724,-0.084,-0.2133,-0.0278,-0.0749,0.045,-0.1046,0.0068,-0.0118,-0.1996,0.0459,-0.0026,-0.0926,0.007,0.0644,0.0299,0.0121,-0.0141,0.0046,-0.0431,-0.0897,-0.1122,0.005,0.0009,-0.1134,-0.0307,-0.0127,0.0248,0.1156,0.0484,-0.1277,0.0205,-0.1748,0.1025,-0.2357,0.0879,-0.0193,-0.0122,0.097,0.2575,0.0332,0.1576,0.0646,0.0231,-0.0669,-0.0135,0.0586],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdChangeLog.md [chunk 22]","tags":["prd","design-doc","what"],"version":1},
{"id":"prdCardOfTheDay.md-chunk-1","text":"# PRD: Card of the Day Display\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThe **Card of the Day** feature adds a rotating featured judoka card to the JU-DO-KON! landing screen. It enhances player engagement by spotlighting a different judoka each day, seasonally, or via manual override. This content block supports dynamic storytelling, gameplay tips, and promotional tie-ins with new or popular cards.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Statement / Why It Matters\n\nCurrently, the JU-DO-KON! landing screen lacks dynamic content, making repeat visits feel static. Players have no reason to check back regularly outside of gameplay. Internal telemetry shows that return visits to the landing screen drop by 20% after the first week of install. By highlighting a **Card of the Day**, we create a lightweight content loop that introduces players to new judoka, encourages curiosity, and showcases collectible variety. It also lays the groundwork for future editorial content, seasonal events, and featured card mechanics.\n\n---\n\n## Goals / Success Metrics\n\n| Goal                                               | Metric                                                                     |\n| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Increase landing screen engagement                 | Avg. dwell time on landing screen increases by 15%                         |\n| Encourage exploration of judoka roster             | ≥30% of users who see the featured card click through to view full details |\n| Achieve stable content refresh without regressions | Featured card rotates or updates successfully in ≥98% of daily sessions    |\n| Enable A/B testing and gradual rollout             | Controlled via `showCardOfTheDay` feature flag                             |\n\n---\n\n## User Stories\n\n- **As a new player**, I want to see a highlighted card when I open the game so that I feel invited to explore more about the game and its characters.\n- **As a returning player**, I","qaContext":"PRD: Card of the Day Display ## TL;DR The **Card of the Day** feature adds a rotating featured judoka card to the JU-DO-KON!","embedding":[-0.0001,0.099,-0.0046,0.0311,0.0288,0.0936,0.126,0.0566,0.1037,-0.0653,-0.047,-0.0678,-0.0184,0.0649,0.0245,-0.0878,0.1517,0.0497,-0.0916,0.0226,-0.0209,-0.142,0.0529,0.0587,-0.0955,0.0134,-0.0267,-0.0127,-0.0825,-0.076,0.0098,0.2491,0.0716,0.0171,-0.0111,-0.0497,-0.0572,-0.0079,-0.0508,-0.0424,-0.1073,-0.0527,0.0169,0.1027,0.0973,-0.1528,-0.061,0.0102,-0.0002,0.1272,-0.1232,-0.0559,0.0521,-0.0491,0.1026,0.0782,-0.0216,-0.0321,0.0288,-0.0065,0.1084,0.0258,-0.0242,0.0536,-0.0169,-0.1685,-0.0435,0.0253,0.0538,0.053,-0.0124,0.045,0.0095,-0.0189,-0.0139,0.0412,-0.0579,-0.0701,-0.0029,-0.1461,0.0221,-0.0297,0.0134,-0.0914,-0.0069,-0.1032,0.0963,-0.0241,-0.0095,0.0038,0.0028,0.091,0.0405,-0.0888,-0.1319,-0.0065,-0.1176,-0.108,-0.0341,0.1713,-0.0281,0.0222,0.046,0.1115,-0.0244,-0.1129,-0.005,0.0525,-0.0974,0.0401,-0.0546,0.0634,-0.0511,-0.0263,0.0063,0.0913,0.0172,0.0113,0.0567,0.0908,0.2161,-0.0767,0.0361,-0.0257,0.0455,-0.0219,0.0863,0,0.0432,-0.0744,0.0152,-0.0125,0.0051,-0.1199,0.0073,-0.1016,-0.0515,-0.0439,0.0084,0.1738,-0.0131,0.12,0.0319,-0.1026,-0.1709,0.0746,0.0062,0.0367,0.0702,-0.114,-0.0348,0.0023,0.0208,0.103,0.0546,-0.062,-0.0743,0.0373,0.0165,-0.152,0.0099,-0.0999,-0.0461,-0.0011,-0.0499,-0.0613,0.035,0.0963,-0.0945,-0.0762,-0.0906,-0.1352,-0.0129,-0.0062,0.0428,-0.0416,-0.0569,0.0423,0.0164,-0.0473,0.0302,-0.0922,-0.0605,-0.0459,-0.0183,-0.0726,0.0124,0.0096,-0.04,-0.0523,-0.1094,0.0159,-0.0817,0.0503,0.0878,-0.0208,-0.0585,0.0058,-0.078,0.0725,0.0916,-0.1359,-0.0962,-0.0665,-0.0475,0.0446,-0.1174,0.0249,0.0409,-0.0782,-0.0434,-0.0292,0.0451,0.0344,0.0937,-0.0975,-0.1806,0.0404,-0.0469,0.0527,0.0306,-0.0004,0.0856,0,0.01,-0.0251,-0.0285,0.0574,0.0738,-0.0001,-0.0292,0.1074,-0.0122,-0.1381,-0.0944,0.0182,-0.1558,0.0206,-0.0606,-0.0123,-0.0022,0.0289,-0.1676,0.1659,0.0857,0.1363,-0.1154,-0.0501,0.0028,0.0413,0.1245,0.0843,-0.0523,-0.0427,0.0031,-0.1401,-0.1412,0.0062,-0.0015,-0.0028,-0.0119,-0.0323,-0.111,0.2302,0.0855,0.0285,-0.0799,0.0074,-0.0596,0.0887,0.0331,0.0025,-0.0089,-0.0771,-0.0343,-0.0266,-0.0665,-0.02,-0.0844,-0.0113,0.0073,-0.0652,0.0062,0.0324,0.0109,-0.0548,-0.0557,-0.0967,0.0955,-0.0651,0.0218,0.0383,-0.0861,-0.0098,-0.0826,-0.0079,-0.048,-0.0573,-0.008,0.139,-0.0245,0.0199,0.064,-0.0518,-0.1658,-0.0644,-0.0336,-0.0746,0.0707,0.1655,-0.2094,0.0513,0.0264,0.0103,-0.0064,-0.0223,0.0515,0.022,-0.0164,0,-0.08,-0.0129,-0.006,0.0404,0.0686,-0.0088,0.0702,-0.0992,0.0124,-0.0587,0.1811,0.0365,-0.0451,0.0511,0.0841,0.0184,-0.025,0.0834,-0.1449,-0.0302,0.0544,-0.0402,0.065,-0.0965,-0.1272,0.0777,-0.0282,-0.0041,0.0935,-0.0507,0.1323,-0.0158,-0.0263,0.0363,0.06,0.023,0.0297,0.001,0.0077,0.1704,-0.0238,-0.0779,-0.0329,0.0269,-0.0166,0.0451,-0.0546,-0.1769,-0.0041,-0.125,-0.0715,-0.2069,0.0087,0.0244,0.0833,0.1517,0.1598,0.057,0.0949,0.085,0.0288,-0.0033,-0.102,0.0707],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdCardOfTheDay.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdCardCodeGeneration.md-chunk-1","text":"# PRD: Card Code Generation Function\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThis PRD defines a Card Code Generation Function for Ju-Do-Kon!, creating short, obfuscated, human-friendly codes representing individual Judoka cards. Players can easily share, recreate, and validate their cards, boosting engagement and social play. Codes are fast to generate (<100ms), readable, tamper-resistant, and optimized for low manual entry error rates.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Overview\n\nThe Card Code Generation Function transforms key attributes of a Judoka (player card) into a **unique, readable alphanumeric code**. This code allows players to easily share, recreate, and validate specific Judoka cards in the game.\n\n> **Player Feedback:**\n>\n> - _\"I want to show my best fighter to my friend!\"_ — Early playtest feedback from a hypothetical 10-year-old user.\n> - _\"Typing long names is annoying. Codes are cooler and easier!\"_ — Anonymous feedback from playtest logs.\n\nPlayers gain a sense of **ownership and pride** by sharing their custom Judoka quickly and easily **(share action <2 s)**. **Without simple sharing, engagement can drop**, especially for kids who expect fast, low-effort interactions (**<200 ms UI response**).\n\n### Goals\n\n- Share and recreate favorite Judoka with a short, easy-to-type code.\n- Avoid frustration with typos or unreadable characters.\n\n### System Features\n\n- **Unique**: Each Judoka’s stats and identity produce a distinct code.\n- **Obfuscated**: Prevents easy manipulation.\n- **Readable**: Uses a limited, kid-friendly character set.\n- **Formatted**: Improves readability and typing accuracy.\n\n### Key Requirements\n\n- **Security and Usability** are equally important.\n- **≤100ms generation time** for producing the code.\n- **Auto-generated** whenever a card is created or updated and saved into `judoka.json`.\n- Code is **visible** on card screens (where relevant).\n- Players can **input shared codes** with a **<2% manual entry error rate**.\n- **Easy copying** and **auto-hyphenation** during code entry for b","qaContext":"PRD: Card Code Generation Function --- ## TL;DR This PRD defines a Card Code Generation Function for Ju-Do-Kon!","embedding":[-0.187,0.1036,-0.1593,0.042,-0.1266,0.0874,0.0829,0.0916,0.0654,-0.0421,0.1391,-0.0956,0.1356,0.0227,-0.0096,0.0117,0.0394,0.0803,-0.1601,0.0177,0.0674,-0.1351,0.0211,0.0539,0.033,0.0182,-0.0869,0.062,-0.1303,-0.0344,0.0594,0.141,0.1821,0.0594,-0.0673,0.0721,-0.0865,0.072,-0.0453,-0.0839,-0.2376,-0.0352,0.0468,0.1745,0.066,0.013,-0.0794,-0.0276,-0.158,0.042,-0.2325,0.053,0.0257,-0.0277,0.1081,-0.1138,-0.0176,-0.0741,-0.0182,0.065,-0.0031,0.0146,-0.0019,0.0424,-0.0602,-0.1456,-0.0034,0.0321,0.0052,0.0361,-0.0851,0.1114,-0.0721,0.1416,0.0087,0.1313,-0.0962,-0.0516,0.0341,-0.1153,-0.0769,-0.0094,0.0329,0.0427,0.045,0.0653,0.1402,0.0558,0.0398,0.0555,0.0034,0.1017,0.1871,-0.0401,0.0091,0.0063,0.0138,-0.1034,-0.1635,0.0919,-0.0825,0.0649,0.0647,-0.0366,0.0477,0.0255,0.0992,0.0127,0.0561,-0.0439,-0.0522,0.0267,-0.1468,-0.0692,-0.0049,0.1985,-0.0448,0.0154,0.1182,0.15,0.1208,-0.1042,-0.0173,0.0751,-0.0043,-0.0395,-0.0156,0,0.021,0.0094,-0.0716,0.1165,-0.0742,-0.1112,-0.0636,-0.1366,-0.1648,0.0034,-0.0311,0.1145,-0.0199,0.2433,0.1189,0.0215,-0.1091,0.0752,0.0009,0.06,0.1481,0.0326,0.0401,-0.0509,0.0643,0.1741,0.0043,-0.1244,0.0452,0.046,-0.0573,-0.177,-0.1425,-0.0722,0.0089,-0.0162,0.0654,-0.0911,-0.0901,0.0631,-0.0526,-0.0829,-0.0909,-0.064,0.0265,-0.0884,-0.0627,0.0812,-0.0115,0.0932,-0.0784,0.1238,0.0511,-0.0131,-0.0975,-0.0002,0.0717,0.0187,0.0172,0.0681,-0.0348,0.0267,-0.0855,-0.0052,0.008,-0.0607,-0.0059,-0.06,0.1143,-0.0236,-0.0618,0.0175,-0.0096,-0.0689,-0.1255,-0.1302,0.0293,0.0526,-0.1159,-0.0839,-0.0641,0.0726,-0.1637,-0.037,-0.0879,0.0483,0.0462,-0.1446,-0.2384,0.1177,0.0145,-0.027,-0.0334,0.0235,0.0339,0,-0.0426,-0.0233,-0.0533,0.1166,0.002,-0.111,0.0055,0.137,0.0308,-0.1478,-0.096,0.0013,-0.0718,-0.1037,0.0709,-0.0636,-0.1226,0.1021,-0.089,0.1029,0.089,0.2525,-0.08,0.0344,-0.0599,0.1022,0.0633,0.0116,0.0011,-0.0497,-0.0095,0.0418,-0.1635,0.0218,-0.0526,-0.1212,0.0326,0.0259,-0.0387,0.2115,0.1192,0.0619,-0.0671,0.0514,-0.0197,0.0439,-0.0389,-0.0846,0.0904,-0.0043,0.0648,-0.0938,-0.113,-0.1078,-0.1571,-0.0727,0.0166,-0.0337,0.0363,0.1022,-0.0754,-0.0773,0.0651,0.0402,0.0691,-0.0862,-0.1268,0.0407,-0.0634,-0.045,0.0093,0.0564,-0.0073,-0.0147,0.0421,-0.0208,-0.0971,0.0513,0.0437,-0.0162,-0.0348,0.0351,0.021,0.0196,0.0326,0.1091,-0.0162,0.0663,-0.035,-0.0545,0.0474,0.1515,0.1399,0.0469,-0.0503,0,-0.0427,-0.0566,-0.0755,0.0982,-0.0005,0.0605,-0.1232,-0.1103,-0.0408,-0.0503,0.2363,0.1047,-0.1395,-0.0659,0.0159,-0.0495,-0.0521,0.1152,-0.0885,0.0576,0.0882,-0.0086,-0.0778,-0.0323,-0.1802,-0.0813,-0.0471,0.0321,0.012,-0.0109,0.1454,-0.0027,0.09,0.0556,0.0249,0.1057,0.016,0.0144,-0.0311,0.1665,-0.0044,-0.1285,-0.1228,-0.0831,-0.0057,-0.0293,-0.0289,-0.2574,-0.0403,-0.0345,-0.0326,-0.0994,-0.1205,-0.0246,0.0667,0.1291,0.0385,0.0057,0.1438,0.039,0.1114,0.0803,-0.0468,0.0795],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdCardCodeGeneration.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

This code allows players to easily share, recreate, and validate specific Judoka cards in the game.\n\n> **Player Feedback:**\n>\n> - _\"I want to show my best fighter to my friend!\"_ — Early playtest feedback from a hypothetical 10-year-old user.\n> - _\"Typing long names is annoying. Codes are cooler and easier!\"_ — Anonymous feedback from playtest logs.\n\nPlayers gain a sense of **ownership and pride** by sharing their custom Judoka quickly and easily **(share action <2 s)**. **Without simple sharing, engagement can drop**, especially for kids who expect fast, low-effort interactions (**<200 ms UI response**).\n\n### Goals\n\n- Share and recreate favorite Judoka with a short, easy-to-type code.\n- Avoid frustration with typos or unreadable characters.\n\n### System Features\n\n- **Unique**: Each Judoka’s stats and identity produce a distinct code.\n- **Obfuscated**: Prevents easy manipulation.\n- **Readable**: Uses a limited, kid-friendly character set.\n- **Formatted**: Improves readability and typing accuracy.\n\n### Key Requirements\n\n- **Security and Usability** are equally important.\n- **≤100ms generation time** for producing the code.\n- **Auto-generated** whenever a card is created or updated and saved into `judoka.json`.\n- Code is **visible** on card screens (where relevant).\n- Players can **input shared codes** with a **<2% manual entry error rate**.\n- **Easy copying** and **auto-hyphenation** during code entry for better usability.\n\n---","qaContext":"1.","embedding":[-0.2053,0.0981,-0.1886,0.0584,-0.1421,0.097,0.1166,0.0685,0.029,-0.0566,0.0915,-0.1156,0.1497,0.0879,-0.0441,0.0125,0.0515,0.0851,-0.1559,-0.0476,0.0734,-0.1301,0.014,0.0777,0.0371,0.0683,-0.054,0.0157,-0.1532,-0.0587,-0.0142,0.0814,0.1843,0.0603,-0.0358,0.0558,-0.0735,0.0785,-0.0386,-0.095,-0.2577,-0.0566,0.07,0.172,0.0779,-0.0146,-0.0925,-0.0426,-0.1224,0.0441,-0.2429,0.0238,0.0106,-0.0504,0.1714,-0.1268,-0.0093,-0.0688,-0.0665,0.0567,0.0002,0.0376,-0.0173,0.0845,-0.0729,-0.1438,0.0071,0.0708,0.0063,0.0529,-0.1265,0.1105,-0.0696,0.1005,0.005,0.1446,-0.0688,-0.0102,0.004,-0.1137,-0.0811,-0.0228,0.0225,0.0334,0.0602,0.083,0.1315,0.0867,0.1048,0.0712,0.0238,0.0736,0.2387,-0.0499,0.0484,-0.0455,0.0553,-0.1247,-0.1417,0.1212,-0.0914,0.011,0.1109,-0.0305,0.0688,0.0222,0.11,0.0167,0.0525,-0.055,-0.0639,0.0394,-0.1776,-0.0665,-0.0041,0.2068,-0.0258,0.0131,0.0702,0.1539,0.1655,-0.1396,-0.0135,0.0822,0.0446,-0.0122,-0.018,0,0.0253,-0.0079,-0.0558,0.1115,-0.1034,-0.1221,-0.0396,-0.1591,-0.1659,0.0086,-0.0405,0.1636,-0.0166,0.2438,0.1439,0.0356,-0.0888,0.0697,-0.0124,0.0901,0.1746,0.0381,-0.0069,-0.0735,0.011,0.1607,-0.0155,-0.144,0.0154,0.0764,-0.0476,-0.1799,-0.1777,-0.0562,-0.0084,-0.0259,0.0787,-0.114,-0.04,0.0545,-0.0215,-0.0978,-0.1273,-0.0728,0.0751,-0.0931,-0.0596,0.0426,-0.0203,0.0999,-0.0917,0.1546,0.0558,-0.0555,-0.1013,0.0003,0.0467,0.0198,0.0507,0.0571,-0.0251,0.0125,-0.1051,-0.0124,0.0027,-0.0533,0.0135,-0.0379,0.1033,0.007,-0.0992,-0.0009,-0.0381,-0.0822,-0.1326,-0.1381,0.0343,0.0576,-0.1147,-0.0988,-0.0237,0.0869,-0.1172,-0.034,-0.0866,0.1039,0.0603,-0.1296,-0.2506,0.1369,0.0103,0.0057,-0.0083,-0.0029,0.0624,0,0.0135,-0.0147,-0.0525,0.1131,-0.0079,-0.1217,-0.0072,0.1226,0.0187,-0.1221,-0.087,0.0288,-0.0543,-0.1088,0.0514,-0.0709,-0.1081,0.0849,-0.1179,0.0887,0.0816,0.2252,-0.0359,-0.015,-0.0783,0.0722,0.0351,0.0024,-0.0023,-0.053,-0.0419,0.021,-0.1353,0.0069,-0.0316,-0.1001,0.0464,0.0206,-0.036,0.2303,0.1322,0.0127,-0.1039,0.0725,-0.0038,0.0393,-0.0475,-0.0413,0.0759,-0.0454,0.0624,-0.1173,-0.0803,-0.1356,-0.1171,-0.0281,0.0834,-0.0733,0.0355,0.1398,-0.0868,-0.0878,0.0484,-0.0071,0.0789,-0.0855,-0.1598,0.0514,-0.032,-0.0288,-0.0309,0.0383,-0.0091,-0.0121,0.0533,-0.0332,-0.0964,0.0233,0.0285,-0.0087,-0.037,0.0706,0.0599,0.044,0.0345,0.0854,-0.0221,0.0861,-0.0482,-0.0499,0.021,0.1474,0.143,0.0367,-0.0436,0,-0.0552,-0.0591,-0.0492,0.1347,-0.0422,0.0756,-0.1505,-0.1409,0.0054,-0.014,0.2179,0.1118,-0.1297,-0.0399,-0.0287,-0.038,-0.041,0.1063,-0.0996,0.0162,0.1091,-0.0405,-0.0285,-0.0576,-0.1761,-0.087,-0.1071,0.0518,0.0013,0.0156,0.1269,-0.0104,0.0633,0.0756,-0.0041,0.0501,0.0064,0.0159,-0.0401,0.0954,-0.0134,-0.0954,-0.1304,-0.0407,0.0467,-0.0188,-0.0361,-0.3071,-0.0623,-0.0874,-0.0072,-0.0903,-0.0676,0.0109,0.0832,0.1429,0.0479,-0.0377,0.1642,0.0264,0.1101,0.0853,-0.0609,0.0631],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdCardCodeGeneration.md [chunk 7]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

Developer Notes\n\n### 9.1 Encoding Strategy Rationale\n\n- **XOR Obfuscation:** Lightweight, fast (**<100 ms**), non-cryptographic.\n- **Readable Character Set:** Improves accuracy (no I, O, 1, 0).\n- **Hyphenation:** Easier error detection.\n- **Versioning:** Ensures backward compatibility.\n\n### 9.3 Limitations\n\n- XOR is not cryptographic.\n- No cryptographic collision-proofing.\n- No decoding to avoid tampering.\n\n### 9.4 Potential Enhancements\n\n- Customizable chunk size.\n- Add checksum digit to detect manual entry errors.\n- Admin-only decode function for tournament verification.\n- Salt/nonce for reduced collisions.\n\n### 9.5 UI Input Considerations\n\n- Code visible on card detail screens, where relevant.\n- Copy-to-clipboard button (44x44px target size).\n- Input field with auto-hyphenation.\n- Invalid character prevention at input level.\n\n---","qaContext":"9.","embedding":[-0.155,0.0488,-0.0806,-0.1359,0.0446,0.0388,0.0399,0.06,-0.1195,-0.1883,0.0332,-0.0542,-0.0169,0.0288,-0.0272,-0.1051,-0.03,0.0945,-0.0995,0.0154,0.1017,-0.1714,-0.0161,0.0273,0.0128,0.0718,-0.1002,-0.07,-0.0392,-0.0937,0.0416,-0.0188,0.1696,0.1096,-0.0295,-0.0098,0.0291,-0.0212,-0.1195,-0.1321,-0.1758,-0.214,-0.0237,0.1411,-0.0684,0.0024,0.0559,0.0264,-0.1301,0.0907,-0.098,-0.0167,0.0196,0.0106,-0.0227,-0.0849,-0.0363,-0.0777,-0.0207,-0.0088,0.0302,0.1196,0.0225,0.112,-0.0263,0.0574,-0.0075,-0.0285,0.0072,0.0087,0.0588,0.0513,-0.1396,-0.0101,-0.0313,0.1337,-0.0869,-0.0774,-0.0143,-0.0541,0.0155,-0.0188,0.0777,0.1365,0.1337,0.0346,0.0418,0.0808,-0.0532,-0.0665,0.0647,0.0837,0.2018,-0.0302,0.1009,0.0791,0.0204,-0.0565,-0.0706,0.1492,-0.051,0.0213,-0.063,-0.0585,0.0864,0.0258,0.1408,0.0944,-0.0458,-0.0671,0.028,0.0425,-0.1156,-0.1012,0.0265,0.0954,-0.0329,0.0938,0.0553,0.1222,-0.025,-0.0659,-0.1641,0.0555,0.1504,0.0532,-0.0366,0,0.0057,0.0608,-0.2161,0.005,-0.0294,-0.0151,-0.0007,0.0148,-0.1545,-0.0029,0.0312,-0.0536,-0.0216,0.0699,0.1798,-0.1492,-0.0158,0.1232,0.0444,-0.0065,0.0796,-0.0912,0.0475,-0.0195,0.1018,0.171,-0.1044,-0.0336,0.1428,0.0234,-0.0953,-0.1903,0.0231,-0.0215,0.0763,0.148,-0.0171,-0.1254,-0.024,-0.0198,-0.0865,-0.099,-0.0652,-0.1694,0.0775,-0.019,-0.0155,0.0149,-0.0282,-0.0133,-0.013,0.1253,-0.0868,-0.0946,0.0132,-0.2991,-0.0049,0.0439,0.0139,0.1337,-0.0284,-0.0025,-0.1194,0.052,-0.1372,0.0129,-0.0456,-0.1529,0.0693,-0.0823,-0.1601,-0.0707,0.012,0.0028,0.049,0.044,0.0387,-0.0343,0.0897,-0.1481,-0.0163,0.103,0.0159,0.0371,-0.0873,-0.0667,0.0679,-0.0212,-0.0948,0.0329,0.0936,-0.0946,-0.0346,-0.0829,-0.0417,0,-0.0152,-0.0643,-0.0053,0.1698,-0.0759,-0.059,-0.0007,0.0421,0.03,-0.2405,-0.1167,0.0376,0.1091,-0.1618,-0.0226,-0.0492,-0.0614,0.1744,0.004,0.0305,0.1621,0.1704,-0.0828,0.0907,0.0462,0.0775,-0.012,-0.0067,0.2089,-0.0484,-0.0633,0.0258,0.0109,0.0022,0.0111,-0.0697,0.1349,0.1858,0.0504,0.0039,0.1724,-0.0571,-0.0955,0.042,-0.0156,0.0864,-0.019,0.1713,-0.0219,0.0624,-0.0005,-0.1361,-0.1305,-0.0534,0.0242,0.139,0.0299,-0.0451,-0.086,0.1307,-0.1421,0.0533,0.033,0.0522,0.0793,-0.037,-0.0669,0.1443,-0.0433,-0.0337,0.0358,-0.0596,0.0111,0.008,0.0281,-0.1094,0.0197,0.0459,0.0756,0.1055,-0.0484,0.054,0.1254,0.087,0.1328,0.1544,0.0958,0.0425,0.0239,-0.116,-0.0478,0.0998,0.1383,0.1128,0.0568,0,0.0388,-0.0407,-0.0368,0.0271,-0.0618,0.0021,-0.0121,-0.1412,-0.0016,-0.023,0.2152,-0.1161,-0.2328,-0.1977,0.0616,-0.0311,0.0041,0.0695,-0.0855,-0.0092,-0.0126,-0.0888,0.0294,-0.0116,-0.1181,-0.0375,-0.07,0.143,0.1695,0.0135,-0.0194,0.0596,0.0854,-0.0176,0.0547,0.0391,-0.0605,0.0619,0.1323,0.0972,-0.0033,-0.1103,-0.145,-0.0262,0.0313,-0.0575,-0.0758,-0.1783,-0.0829,-0.0777,0.0599,0.0536,-0.0415,0.0972,0.0738,0.0943,0.057,-0.087,0.1047,0.0649,0.1773,0.0639,0.0158,-0.0777],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdCardCodeGeneration.md [chunk 27]","tags":["prd","design-doc","what"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdCardCarousel.md-chunk-1","text":"# PRD: Judoka Card Carousel\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThis PRD defines a responsive, interactive carousel for browsing Judoka cards in Ju-Do-Kon! It supports smooth swiping (**snap ≤200 ms**), keyboard interactions, and accessibility features — ensuring players can quickly scan and select cards.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nAs part of the game, several screens require an intuitive and interactive way to present judoka cards. With more than 100 cards in the game (ultimate goal), it would be cumbersome and frustrating for players to browse through all cards manually without an efficient navigation system capable of loading **100 cards in ≤1 s**.\n\n> Emi wants to create her ultimate Japanese Judoka team. She opens the carousel and quickly swipes through beautifully animated cards, instantly comparing stats.

Other features (e.g., Browse Judoka) reference this document for carousel-related behaviors, performance targets, and accessibility. Any updates to carousel requirements should be made here and referenced elsewhere to avoid redundancy.\n\n---\n\n## Edge Cases / Failure States\n\n- **Network Disconnection**: Display a default judoka card (judoka id=0).\n- **Missing/Broken Card Images**: Default fallback card is shown, display a default judoka card (judoka id=0).\n- **Slow Network**: Show a loading spinner if loading exceeds 2 seconds.\n\n---\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n- Cards should lazy-load images as they enter the viewport to reduce initial load time.\n- Use hardware-accelerated CSS transforms (e.g., `translate3d`) for smooth scrolling and animations (**≥60 fps**).\n- Carousel should debounce swipe/scroll events to prevent rapid-fire performance hits.\n- Card metadata must be dynamically fetched from `judoka.json`; errors should gracefully fallback to judoka id=0.\n\n---\n\n## Player Flow\n\n1. A page calls `buildCardCarousel(judokaList, gokyoData)` from `src/helpers/carouselBuilder.js`.\n2. The returned element is mounted into the page (for example, `browseJudoka.html` inserts it into `#carousel-container`).\n3. Carousel loads cards within 1 second; a loading spinner appears if delayed.\n4. Player uses:\n   - Large \"Prev\" and \"Next\" arrow buttons to move left or right,\n   - Swipe or scroll gestures on mobile,\n   - Or keyboard arrows for navigation.\n5. Hovering enlarges cards (desktop).\n6. Page markers show \"current page of total\" with active highlight.\n7.

Players first see a country filter panel alongside a card carousel.\n\nThe carousel relies on the `buildCardCarousel` helper ([prdCardCarousel.md](prdCardCarousel.md)) and filtering uses the Country Flag Picker ([prdCountryPickerFilter.md](prdCountryPickerFilter.md)).\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nBrowse Judoka includes a scrollable, responsive carousel that allows players to view every available judoka card, fostering exploration, strategic team building, and a sense of ownership. This PRD defines how to implement a performant, accessible browsing experience across mobile and desktop.\n\n> Kai hears that a new rare judoka has been added to the game, and excitedly visits the Browse Judoka screen. Swiping through the collection, he sees cards elegantly snap into place. The center card zooms slightly as it comes into focus, making it feel like a physical binder.

{"id":"prdBattleInfoBar.md-chunk-1","text":"# Battle Info Bar PRD\n\n## TL;DR\n\nDisplays round messages, a countdown timer, and live match score in the page header so players always know the current battle status. The Info Bar also manages the stat selection timer and fallback logic, as required by Classic Battle mode.\n\n---\n\n## Description\n\nIn battle game modes (e.g. Classic Battle), players have a real need to receive clear visual feedback between or after rounds. Without this info, it will leave users uncertain about match state, leading to confusion, reduced immersion, and increased risk of game abandonment. Players could feel \"lost\" due to a lack of timely updates about round outcomes, next steps, or overall progress.\n\nThe round message, timer, and score now sit directly inside the page header rather than in a separate bar. The Info Bar also displays the stat selection timer (30 seconds by default), and triggers auto-selection if the timer expires, as specified in Classic Battle requirements. The timer must pause if the game tab is inactive or device goes to sleep, and resume on focus (see Classic Battle PRD).\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n1. **Display match score (player vs opponent)** on the **right side of the top bar**, updated at the **end of each round**, within **800ms** of score finalization.\n2. **Display round-specific messaging** on the **left side of the top bar**, depending on match state:\n   - If a round ends: show **win/loss/result** message for **2 seconds**.\n   - If awaiting action: show **selection prompt** until a decision is made.\n   - If waiting for next round: show **countdown timer** that begins **within 1s** of round end.\n   - If in stat selection phase: show **30-second countdown timer** and prompt; if timer expires, auto-select a stat (see Classic Battle PRD).\n3. Ensure all messages are clearly readable, positioned responsively, and maintain usability across devices.\n4. Display fallback messages within 500ms of sync failure.\n\n---\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n| Priority | Feature                | D","qaContext":"Battle Info Bar PRD ## TL;DR Displays round messages, a countdown timer, and live match score in the page header so players always know the current battle st...","embedding":[-0.0829,0.1292,-0.0796,0.0022,0.0856,0.1423,0.024,0.0638,0.1151,0.0348,-0.0424,-0.0723,0.0368,0.0046,-0.0477,-0.0522,0.0313,-0.0708,-0.0035,0.0283,0.0942,-0.0327,0.0187,0.0888,-0.034,0.0069,-0.0772,0.0626,-0.1065,-0.0314,0.0102,0.0504,0.0836,0.0253,-0.117,-0.1496,0.0159,0.0785,-0.0802,-0.1074,-0.0546,-0.0678,-0.0245,0.0729,0.0363,0.0093,-0.1551,-0.0322,-0.0609,0.0867,-0.0504,-0.0284,0.0312,-0.0589,0.1232,0.1177,0.0396,-0.0268,-0.0587,0.1153,-0.0568,-0.0968,-0.0609,0.0133,0.0096,0.0878,0.1101,-0.023,0.0642,0.0136,-0.0824,0.0837,-0.0162,-0.0548,0.0026,0.0456,-0.1843,-0.0594,-0.0238,-0.1616,-0.0925,-0.0051,-0.0542,0.0328,0.1357,-0.1214,0.1568,0.0428,0.1132,-0.0009,-0.0649,-0.0055,0.0069,0.1573,0.0066,0.1249,-0.0731,0.0231,0.0344,0.036,-0.0002,0.0008,-0.0556,0.0015,0.0561,-0.0857,0.0577,0.0706,-0.0576,0.0088,0.0114,-0.0163,0.0877,-0.0479,0.0256,0.124,0.0166,0.0693,0.0922,0.0036,0.1084,0.005,-0.0976,-0.0853,0.1108,0.0693,0.0664,0,0.017,-0.2011,-0.1273,0.1136,0.0008,0.0755,-0.063,-0.0375,-0.0068,-0.018,-0.0681,0.1058,-0.0338,-0.0378,0.0522,-0.0728,0.0047,0.1627,0.0119,-0.0291,0.1235,-0.0927,-0.0941,-0.0449,0.2354,0.3,0.019,0.0447,-0.082,-0.0032,-0.0285,-0.1211,-0.007,-0.0191,0.0786,-0.0351,-0.0973,-0.011,0.0232,0.0787,-0.1336,-0.0891,-0.2117,-0.0602,-0.1355,-0.1367,-0.0865,0.0252,0.0168,0.0486,0.007,0.0785,-0.0542,-0.0788,-0.0326,-0.0294,-0.0726,-0.0312,-0.0402,0.1245,0.0011,0.0489,-0.0196,-0.0508,-0.0796,0.0915,-0.0652,-0.0679,-0.0496,-0.1118,-0.0133,0.0207,0.1582,-0.0402,-0.0338,-0.0644,0.1485,0.0502,-0.0862,-0.0811,0.0752,-0.1403,-0.0949,-0.0073,0.0744,-0.0944,0.0838,-0.1149,-0.2536,-0.0675,-0.1081,-0.0888,0.0548,0.097,-0.0495,0,-0.0061,-0.0658,0.0025,0.0145,0.0603,0.033,0.0179,0.0275,-0.0094,-0.0692,0.0114,0.0334,-0.0795,-0.0185,-0.0906,0.0797,0.0416,-0.0287,-0.0771,0.0802,0.1356,0.0538,-0.1721,-0.0561,-0.0159,0.0058,0.1005,0.0101,0.0504,-0.0896,0.1432,-0.1277,-0.0976,-0.0604,0.0672,-0.0558,0.1401,-0.0738,-0.1104,0.2166,0.2365,0.0843,-0.0925,-0.0106,-0.0353,0.206,0.0173,-0.0956,-0.0226,-0.0195,0.0473,-0.0804,0.0503,0.0351,-0.152,-0.047,-0.0056,0.0261,-0.106,0.0759,0.0893,-0.0559,-0.0087,0.0294,0.1076,0.1297,0.0063,0.0396,-0.025,0.1037,-0.02,-0.0211,-0.0528,-0.0621,0.1038,0.0682,-0.0862,-0.027,-0.0717,0.0343,-0.043,-0.0584,0.0676,-0.02,-0.0908,0.1292,-0.0765,0.1929,0.1015,-0.0241,-0.0847,0.0039,-0.039,0.0836,-0.0405,0,-0.0999,-0.0639,0.0791,-0.012,0.067,0.0225,-0.0018,-0.1005,-0.0377,-0.07,0.1672,-0.0126,-0.0476,-0.1757,0.0587,-0.0024,-0.0783,-0.0036,-0.0419,-0.0443,-0.0307,-0.0002,-0.0395,-0.0305,-0.0433,0.0248,0.0341,0.1731,0.0118,-0.0577,0.0736,0.0822,0.0296,-0.0172,0.0047,0.0745,0.0567,0.0158,0.0925,0.1873,-0.0906,-0.0914,-0.111,0.0381,0.0641,0.0059,-0.0886,-0.1146,-0.0742,-0.0729,-0.0046,-0.021,-0.0239,0.1224,0.0503,0.0864,0.1068,-0.0589,0.0444,0.0638,0.0119,0.0317,-0.0557,0.0724],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdBattleInfoBar.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-doc","why"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdBattleInfoBar.md-chunk-8","text":"## Description\n\nIn battle game modes (e.g. Classic Battle), players have a real need to receive clear visual feedback between or after rounds. Without this info, it will leave users uncertain about match state, leading to confusion, reduced immersion, and increased risk of game abandonment. Players could feel \"lost\" due to a lack of timely updates about round outcomes, next steps, or overall progress.\n\nThe round message, timer, and score now sit directly inside the page header rather than in a separate bar. The Info Bar also displays the stat selection timer (30 seconds by default), and triggers auto-selection if the timer expires, as specified in Classic Battle requirements. The timer must pause if the game tab is inactive or device goes to sleep, and resume on focus (see Classic Battle PRD).\n\n---","qaContext":"Description In battle game modes (e.","embedding":[-0.0445,0.1331,-0.0281,0.0315,0.1292,0.2158,0.1524,0.0406,0.1298,-0.0237,-0.0535,-0.0259,0.0073,-0.0332,-0.0115,-0.1023,0.0087,-0.1047,0.0701,-0.0077,0.137,0.0437,0.0921,0.1244,0.0283,0.033,-0.0922,0.0782,-0.001,-0.041,-0.056,0.121,0.0627,-0.0322,-0.185,-0.1728,-0.0131,0.1387,-0.0752,-0.0356,-0.0517,-0.1147,0.0233,0.1387,0.0202,0.0994,-0.192,-0.0496,-0.0666,0.0852,-0.0298,-0.0575,0.0974,-0.1023,0.0759,0.0953,0.0507,-0.0188,0.0044,0.1121,-0.1562,-0.0709,-0.0452,-0.0355,0.017,0.0935,0.1173,-0.0723,-0.0093,0.0019,-0.0146,0.0731,0.0495,-0.0446,0.0233,0.0193,-0.202,-0.0679,0.0083,-0.0141,-0.1061,-0.097,0.0226,0.0491,0.1355,-0.0838,0.2146,0.0326,0.0509,0.0486,-0.1188,0.0169,0.0088,0.1647,-0.0257,0.1359,-0.0807,0.0224,0.0058,0.0601,0.0854,-0.0152,-0.0333,0.0119,0.0058,-0.0507,0.1738,0.1121,0.0101,-0.0258,0.0358,-0.0325,0.033,-0.044,-0.0385,0.1619,0.0215,-0.0051,0.1303,-0.0347,0.0661,-0.045,-0.1537,-0.1718,0.1083,0.1452,0.0307,0,-0.0031,-0.2321,-0.1562,0.176,-0.0594,0.073,-0.0811,-0.042,-0.006,-0.0295,-0.0683,0.0063,-0.0288,-0.0137,0.0622,-0.1075,0.0165,0.138,-0.0306,-0.0846,0.0653,-0.0522,-0.0739,-0.0145,0.1335,0.3652,-0.0214,-0.0119,-0.1164,0.0137,-0.0558,-0.0583,-0.0344,-0.041,0.0726,-0.031,-0.0533,0.0185,0.0484,0.0686,-0.0983,0.0587,-0.1682,-0.0639,-0.1232,-0.0803,-0.0892,0.1134,-0.1139,0.1002,-0.0489,0.1398,-0.0117,-0.0434,0.0214,0.0341,-0.0962,-0.0058,-0.1043,0.0684,0.0462,0.0858,0.0852,-0.0565,-0.1061,0.1425,-0.1277,-0.0477,-0.0851,-0.1403,0.0307,0.0562,0.0736,0.0122,-0.0636,-0.0469,0.151,0.0038,-0.0257,-0.1136,0.2348,-0.1146,-0.0781,-0.0283,0.0394,-0.0444,0.112,-0.1822,-0.22,-0.0467,-0.0588,-0.052,0.0303,0.1085,-0.1222,0,0.0497,-0.047,0.0057,0.05,0.0915,0.0854,0.0762,0.0061,0.0418,-0.0146,0.0625,0.1072,-0.1796,-0.035,-0.0694,-0.0357,0.0195,-0.0241,-0.0201,0.0967,0.2255,-0.1146,-0.1664,-0.0781,-0.022,-0.0044,0.0688,-0.0221,0.0367,-0.084,0.1537,-0.1021,0.0124,-0.0318,0.0952,-0.0328,0.1214,-0.1013,-0.1032,0.2383,0.1981,0.0799,-0.0665,-0.0237,-0.0675,0.2296,0.0983,-0.1337,-0.1024,-0.0305,0.0783,-0.1113,-0.0141,-0.0106,-0.2264,-0.0391,-0.0794,0.037,-0.1644,0.0825,0.1323,-0.0221,-0.0549,0.0153,0.0743,0.0926,-0.0116,-0.0192,0.0361,0.0964,-0.0341,-0.0468,-0.0451,-0.0384,0.0567,0.0921,-0.0079,0.0109,-0.0634,-0.0074,0.0075,-0.0416,-0.015,-0.1121,-0.0789,0.1566,-0.0606,0.1759,0.0304,-0.0271,-0.0208,0.0344,-0.0142,0.1098,-0.0817,0,-0.1083,-0.0605,0.0468,0.0199,-0.017,0.0122,0.0158,-0.1228,-0.0237,0.0006,0.1088,-0.0243,0.0238,-0.1824,0.0418,0.0459,-0.1031,0.0067,-0.0346,-0.0322,-0.0713,-0.0504,-0.0468,-0.0758,-0.0866,0.0762,-0.0247,0.254,-0.0534,-0.056,0.0896,0.197,-0.0092,-0.0283,-0.0162,0.0566,0.0011,-0.0026,0.1583,0.1155,-0.1441,-0.1213,-0.1312,0.0577,-0.0167,0.0757,-0.027,-0.0656,-0.1508,-0.068,0.0759,-0.0371,0.0056,0.1332,0.0564,0.0822,0.1751,-0.0475,0.0432,-0.0279,0.0101,-0.0212,-0.0952,0.0026],"source":"design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdBattleInfoBar.md [chunk 8]","tags":["prd","design-doc","how"],"version":1},

{"id":"settingsPageDesignGuidelines.md-chunk-1","text":"# JU-DO-KON! Settings Page Design Guidelines\n\nTo ensure the **Settings** page remains consistent, visually appealing, and accessible as new features are added, developers and AI agents should follow these guidelines. The goal is to preserve a unified layout and style while maintaining high accessibility standards.\n\n---\n\n## Layout Guidelines\n\n- **Section Grouping with Fieldsets**  \n  Organize settings into logical sections using `<fieldset>` elements with descriptive `<legend>` titles. Each section (e.g. “Display Settings”, “General Settings”, “Game Modes”) should group related controls.  \n  _Example: The page currently has a “General Settings” fieldset for toggles like Sound, Navigation Map, and Motion._\n\n- **Consistent Form Structure**  \n  Use one `<form>` per section or a single form containing multiple `<fieldset>`s. Ensure consistency across all sections.\n\n- **Settings Item Container**  \n  Wrap each setting control in a `<div class=\"settings-item\">` for modularity and consistent spacing.\n\n- **Grid Layout for Controls**\n  Use the `.game-mode-toggle-container` class on fieldsets to enable responsive grid layouts:\n\n  - 3-column layout on desktop\n  - 1-column stacked layout on mobile\n  - The `Feature Flags` fieldset should include this class so flags display in a responsive grid.\n\n- **Responsive Design Preservation**  \n  New settings should stack vertically on mobile and arrange into columns on larger screens without breaking layout.\n\n- **Page Hierarchy**  \n  Maintain a logical top-down structure: main title `<h1>`, followed by fieldsets in an intuitive order (e.g. general → game-specific → advanced).\n\n- **Navigation and Tab Order**\n  Place controls in top-down, left-to-right order in the HTML to preserve logical keyboard navigation.\n\n### Settings Item Structure\n\nEach toggle or control should display a label followed by a short description.\nReuse the following markup for general settings, game modes, and feature flags:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"settings-item\">\n  <label f","qaContext":"JU-DO-KON!","embedding":[-0.0736,0.0778,-0.0363,0.0341,0.0447,0.1369,0.018,0.028,-0.1232,0.008,-0.0129,0.0638,0.0821,-0.1242,0.1173,0.0048,-0.0337,-0.0077,-0.0991,0.0377,0.0083,-0.127,0.1194,-0.094,-0.1712,0.1825,-0.0663,0.1116,-0.08,-0.1329,-0.0068,0.0999,-0.0081,-0.0046,-0.0509,-0.0228,-0.042,0.0166,-0.0823,-0.0343,-0.1664,-0.0582,0.0412,0.0318,-0.0358,0.0676,-0.1435,-0.1297,-0.0174,0.0211,-0.0285,-0.0753,0.1271,-0.0195,0.0312,0.092,-0.04,0.0513,0.0374,0.034,-0.0116,0.0572,0.0053,0.1089,-0.0202,0.0778,-0.0783,0.0144,-0.0303,0.0316,-0.0772,0.0313,0.1327,-0.0417,-0.0063,-0.0247,-0.1515,-0.0636,-0.071,-0.085,0.0371,0.1253,-0.0834,0.038,-0.0165,-0.1244,0.0223,-0.0651,-0.0108,0.0208,-0.0647,-0.1826,0.1313,-0.0033,-0.0638,0.1111,-0.0443,-0.1469,-0.0703,0.0165,0.0029,-0.055,0.1122,0.0464,0.0601,-0.1257,-0.0092,0.0968,-0.0763,0.0638,0.0435,0.0566,-0.1757,-0.0892,0.0479,0.0512,0.1028,0.0017,0.1563,-0.0133,0.1271,-0.016,-0.0868,-0.08,0.1266,0.0714,-0.1089,0,0.0747,-0.0396,-0.1155,0.1091,0.1365,0.0162,-0.0253,0.0476,-0.0847,0.0912,0.0509,0.0844,-0.1847,0.0324,0.0563,-0.1664,0.0249,0.1226,-0.0227,-0.1247,-0.0393,-0.0047,0.0132,-0.0666,0.1717,0.1491,-0.0322,0.081,-0.1162,-0.0352,-0.0016,-0.0298,0.031,-0.0502,-0.0479,0.0382,-0.091,-0.0236,0.0814,0.0474,-0.0571,-0.1259,0.0244,-0.0899,-0.0348,0.0436,0.0443,0.0225,0.1261,-0.0805,-0.0536,-0.0039,-0.0054,-0.1384,0.1356,-0.1436,-0.115,0.0851,0.0604,0.128,0.0603,-0.0494,-0.0202,0.0361,0.0071,0.1056,0.0238,-0.0631,0.0309,-0.1812,-0.0928,0.0304,0.105,0.0207,-0.0079,-0.0221,-0.0946,-0.1547,-0.1472,-0.0171,-0.041,0.0634,-0.0864,0.1185,0.063,-0.1578,0.1119,-0.0054,-0.1176,-0.0948,-0.1171,-0.0087,0.0657,-0.0702,-0.0547,0,0.027,0.0042,-0.0579,0.0413,0.0576,0.0468,0.1119,0.1288,0.1135,-0.0016,-0.0195,0.0488,-0.0477,-0.1921,-0.1664,0.1347,-0.1688,0.0322,0.0916,0.0294,-0.0058,0.0701,-0.0589,0.0996,-0.0163,-0.0823,0.0309,0.0864,0.0237,0.0607,0.0304,-0.052,0.0137,0.0399,0.0526,-0.0835,-0.0061,0.0103,-0.1533,0.1398,0.0077,-0.0103,-0.015,-0.0012,0.0017,0.1468,0.0974,-0.004,-0.1236,-0.058,-0.0547,-0.1858,-0.0574,-0.1305,-0.0427,0.0526,-0.0646,0.0615,-0.0666,0.0088,0.0844,-0.0095,-0.1039,0.0746,0.1268,0.0716,-0.0642,0.0001,-0.0315,-0.043,-0.0935,-0.1552,0.0363,-0.1193,0.0345,-0.0356,0.0967,-0.0089,0.0808,0.0034,0.0201,-0.0113,-0.0913,-0.0461,-0.0006,0.177,-0.0957,0.1053,0.0211,0.0381,-0.1171,0.073,0.1589,0.1086,-0.1291,0,0.0358,-0.0569,0.017,-0.0696,-0.0343,-0.0068,0.1112,-0.0165,-0.0858,0.0036,0.0817,0.1353,-0.0285,0.0412,0.0477,0.0201,-0.0714,0.2631,-0.0802,0.0275,0.179,-0.02,0.0118,0.0708,0.1038,0.0486,-0.1301,-0.007,0.1084,0.0291,0.1004,-0.0511,0.0525,0.1415,-0.051,-0.0404,-0.1117,-0.015,0.11,0.1157,-0.0051,-0.1513,-0.0968,0.0198,-0.0032,0.1004,-0.0005,0.0805,-0.0135,-0.0677,-0.1461,0.062,0.0356,-0.0465,0.168,0.0796,0.0761,0.1032,0.1074,-0.0809,-0.0186,0.1639,-0.0447,0.0087],"source":"design/codeStandards/settingsPageDesignGuidelines.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-guideline","why"],"version":1},

`.settings-form` on form/fieldset wrappers\n  - `.settings-item` on individual setting containers\n\n- **Fieldset Styling**\n\n  - Reuse section `<legend>` headings with consistent styles (font: Russo One, 24px).\n\n- **Toggle Switch Pattern**\n  Use the existing custom toggle structure:\n\n  ```html\n  <label for=\"new-toggle-id\" class=\"switch\">\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"new-toggle-id\" name=\"newSetting\" aria-label=\"New Setting Name\" />\n    <div class=\"slider round\"></div>\n    <span>New Setting Name</span>\n  </label>\n  ```\n\n- **Select Boxes / Radio Buttons**\n\n  - Use standard `<select>` or `<input type=\"radio\">`, styled within the form using built-in styles (dark background, padding, rounded borders).\n\n- **Typography**\n\n  - Headings: Russo One\n  - Body text: use base font set in `base.css`\n\n- **Colors**\n\n  - Use CSS variables: `--color-primary`, `--button-bg`, etc.\n  - Do not hard-code color values.\n  - Ensure all new elements work across Light, Dark, and Gray themes.\n\n- **Spacing and Sizing**\n  - Use `--space-sm`, `--space-md`, etc. for margins/padding\n  -

This pattern enhances accessibility and scalability as more settings are added.\n\n### Markup Example\n\n```html\n<div class=\"settings-section\">\n  <button\n    type=\"button\"\n    class=\"settings-section-toggle\"\n    aria-expanded=\"false\"\n    aria-controls=\"general-settings-content\"\n    id=\"general-settings-toggle\"\n  >\n    General Settings\n  </button>\n  <div\n    class=\"settings-section-content\"\n    id=\"general-settings-content\"\n    role=\"region\"\n    aria-labelledby=\"general-settings-toggle\"\n    hidden\n  >\n    <fieldset>...settings controls...</fieldset>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n- Repeat for each section (e.g., Game Modes).\n- The toggle button must be keyboard-focusable and operable (Enter/Space).\n- Toggle buttons must use `type=\"button\"` to avoid submitting the form.\n- Use `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, and `aria-labelledby` for accessibility.\n- The content div should be hidden by default (`hidden` attribute or `display: none;`).\n\n### Interaction & Accessibility\n\n- Clicking or pressing Enter/Space on the toggle expands/collapses the section and updates `aria-expanded`.\n- Only one or multiple sections may be open at a time (choose per UX needs).\n- All controls inside the section remain tabbable and accessible when expanded.\n- Use CSS transitions for smooth expand/collapse if desired.\n\n### Styling\n\n- Use `.settings-section`, `.settings-section-toggle`, and `.settings-section-content` classes for structure and styling.\n- Ensure toggle buttons and content meet touch target","qaContext":"tainer (e.","embedding":[-0.026,0.0189,0.0208,0.1815,0.0485,0.1164,0.0708,0.0343,-0.0771,-0.0566,0.0175,0.015,0.0663,-0.082,0.0854,-0.0272,-0.1246,-0.0409,-0.1255,-0.0696,0.0766,-0.1308,0.0296,-0.0516,-0.1448,0.0712,-0.0779,0.0304,-0.0431,-0.0738,0.0479,-0.0052,-0.0241,-0.0796,-0.0069,-0.0213,0.0272,0.0432,-0.0404,-0.0063,-0.1867,-0.0513,0.0154,-0.0815,0.0095,-0.0548,-0.0961,-0.0865,0.0301,-0.0204,0.0136,-0.047,0.1765,0.0229,0.0239,-0.0017,-0.0516,0.0246,-0.0233,0.047,-0.0509,-0.0208,0.0709,0.0412,-0.0019,0.1519,-0.0488,-0.1012,-0.0892,0.0928,-0.0685,-0.016,-0.0159,0.0349,0.0043,-0.0872,-0.0979,0.0302,-0.0366,-0.0286,0.0005,-0.0208,-0.0937,-0.0013,-0.0545,-0.0374,-0.0085,-0.0363,-0.0756,-0.0276,-0.066,-0.0847,0.0211,0.0529,-0.0065,-0.0009,-0.044,-0.1188,-0.0129,0.0278,-0.0541,-0.0948,0.0213,0.0215,-0.0036,-0.0581,-0.0526,0.024,-0.0803,0.1011,0.0284,0.0438,-0.0194,-0.0312,0.0645,0.0693,0.1362,0.0567,0.1229,0.0394,0.2671,0.0464,-0.082,-0.0438,0.1573,-0.044,-0.039,0,0.1194,-0.1234,-0.2437,0.1655,0.1457,0.0617,0.0846,-0.0235,-0.1329,0.0219,0.0258,0.101,-0.1662,-0.0585,0.1155,-0.0386,0.0983,0.1368,-0.0281,-0.1383,0.0143,0.0652,0.0052,0.016,0.1215,0.1398,-0.0448,0.0243,-0.1316,-0.0165,-0.0134,0.0218,-0.0201,-0.0602,0.0532,-0.0356,-0.0427,0.0487,0.0588,0.0201,-0.0687,-0.1674,0.091,-0.0586,-0.0623,0.0299,0.12,0.1271,0.053,-0.1107,0.0411,0.0815,-0.0413,-0.1647,0.1117,-0.0571,-0.1383,0.0394,0.005,0.1057,0.046,-0.0365,-0.0112,0.041,-0.0572,0.0566,0.0354,-0.0406,0.0077,-0.1457,-0.1241,0.0774,0.1195,0.0268,0.0088,-0.1061,-0.0384,-0.1392,-0.0435,-0.0574,0.0471,-0.0297,-0.0555,0.0689,0.0324,-0.0861,0.1208,0.0508,-0.1354,-0.0414,-0.1241,-0.0322,0.1522,-0.1207,0.0056,0,0.0784,0.0229,-0.0757,0.0375,-0.0042,0.0597,0.126,0.1817,0.0622,-0.0966,-0.0231,0.0556,0.0151,-0.1497,-0.2901,0.1856,-0.1071,0.0672,0.0176,0.0636,-0.0005,-0.0268,-0.0665,-0.0167,-0.0842,-0.0555,-0.0871,0.1141,0.0548,0.0068,-0.0028,0.0678,-0.0565,-0.0296,0.0236,-0.0696,-0.065,-0.064,-0.0747,0.0961,0.084,0.0097,0.0036,-0.07,0.0029,0.2412,0.0882,-0.003,-0.2017,0.053,-0.0234,-0.1577,-0.0422,0.0391,0.0343,0.0749,-0.031,-0.0994,-0.1132,0.0779,0.081,-0.0315,-0.0735,0.086,0.1072,0.104,-0.0181,0.067,0.0144,-0.0745,-0.0091,-0.2519,0.1612,-0.1613,0.0717,0.0436,-0.0237,-0.0858,0.0553,0.0177,-0.0088,-0.0241,-0.0895,-0.142,-0.0275,0.1493,-0.1098,0.1219,0.0524,0.0723,-0.0768,-0.0022,0.2369,-0.0345,-0.0522,0,0.0167,-0.0687,-0.0408,-0.139,0.0041,-0.0162,0.0362,-0.0122,-0.0795,-0.0259,0.086,0.0748,0.029,-0.045,-0.0236,0.0696,-0.0616,0.1786,-0.0511,-0.0029,0.0689,-0.0577,0.0225,0.0751,0.0503,0.0172,-0.1763,-0.0145,0.0881,0.0251,0.0544,-0.08,0.0097,0.1462,-0.1226,0.0573,0.0031,0.0094,0.0809,0.1431,0.0999,-0.2023,-0.0758,0.0065,-0.0839,-0.0168,-0.016,-0.0138,0.0277,0.0243,-0.0553,0.0547,0.0666,-0.0106,0.1209,0.0364,0.086,0.0785,0.0167,-0.0205,-0.0244,0.0722,0.0458,0.0525],"source":"design/codeStandards/settingsPageDesignGuidelines.md [chunk 4]","tags":["prd","design-guideline","what"],"version":1},

For player-facing instructions see the [README section on Settings & Feature Flags](../../README.md#settings--feature-flags).\n\n### 🧩 Feature Flags – Implementation Guidelines\n\n- **Use Toggle Switch Pattern**  \n  Every feature flag should be implemented as a standard toggle using the existing `.switch` structure (see Styling Guidelines).\n\n- **ID and Naming Convention**  \n  Use predictable `id` and `name` values:\n\n  - ID format: `feature-<kebab-case-feature-name>`\n  - Name format: camelCase\n  - Example: `id=\"feature-random-stat-mode\" name=\"randomStatMode\"`\n  - Common example flags include `Battle Debug Panel`, `Full Navigation Map`, and `Card Inspector`\n\n- **ARIA and Accessibility**\n\n  - Provide `aria-label` for each feature flag\n  - Label must describe the feature clearly, even if experimental\n\n- **Persistence & Feedback**\n\n  - Use the `updateSetting()` pattern to store and reflect current flag states\n  - UI must reflect the saved state on load and provide immediate visual feedback on toggle\n\n- **Grouping**\n  - Place all feature flags in a dedicated `<fieldset>` titled `Feature Flags`\n  - For advanced/experimental features, nest under `Advanced Settings` with appropriate section toggling\n  - Markup example:","qaContext":"on-content` classes for structure and styling.","embedding":[-0.0335,0.0043,-0.0066,0.0633,0.0663,0.0741,0.0882,0.0195,-0.1844,0.0294,0.0268,-0.0823,0.0025,-0.0293,0.0821,0.0632,0.0863,-0.0455,-0.0144,-0.0114,0.0471,-0.1126,0.0385,-0.0219,-0.1625,0.1255,0.0065,-0.0529,-0.0814,-0.1289,0.0247,0.073,-0.1464,-0.0437,-0.0302,-0.0664,-0.0781,-0.0637,-0.0673,-0.0857,-0.1099,-0.0504,-0.0736,-0.0443,0.0049,-0.0723,-0.0997,-0.0592,0.0042,-0.0357,-0.017,-0.033,0.0875,-0.0277,0.0999,-0.0015,-0.0086,0.0798,0.0755,0.0467,0.0088,0.0255,0.0439,0.066,0.0264,0.0807,0.018,-0.0849,0.0554,0.0053,-0.1454,0.0196,0.121,-0.006,0.0164,-0.0508,-0.0564,-0.0005,0.0184,-0.1451,-0.0715,-0.0152,-0.0445,0.021,-0.0046,0.0085,0.045,-0.0284,0.0077,-0.0174,0.0245,-0.0977,0.0067,-0.0805,-0.0303,-0.0002,-0.0048,-0.0255,-0.0737,0.0879,0.0302,-0.0381,0.0763,0.0956,0.0375,-0.0597,0.0531,-0.0389,-0.0595,0.0555,-0.0037,0.0826,-0.0246,-0.1095,0.0144,0.0308,0.0766,0.0509,0.1279,0.0941,0.2299,-0.0407,-0.0735,-0.0444,0.1408,0.1396,-0.0739,0,0.1942,-0.0954,-0.141,0.0394,0.0321,-0.02,0.1131,0.0597,-0.1435,0.0494,-0.0068,0.0902,-0.1505,0.0504,0.0875,-0.0747,-0.0558,-0.0015,0.0024,-0.0852,0.0241,-0.0516,-0.0256,0.041,0.0697,0.086,-0.0562,0.0026,-0.1699,0.0532,0.0083,-0.0218,-0.045,0.014,-0.1391,-0.0656,-0.1145,-0.0205,0.0832,0.0219,-0.014,-0.139,0.0247,-0.0875,-0.0224,-0.0338,0.0258,0.0153,0.1137,-0.0524,0.0769,-0.0393,0.02,-0.1516,0.0497,-0.0295,-0.0193,0.0376,0.0494,0.1652,-0.0707,0.0219,-0.0019,0.0368,-0.0251,0.1021,0.0546,-0.0516,0.0038,-0.1507,-0.1692,0.0368,0.1061,-0.0017,-0.0171,-0.1101,-0.0282,-0.1327,-0.1131,-0.0817,0.1223,0.0251,-0.045,0.0912,0.1114,-0.1429,0.0442,-0.019,-0.1551,-0.0619,-0.0142,-0.0115,0.0878,-0.1264,0.0095,0,0.0141,-0.0415,-0.0604,0.1063,-0.0576,-0.0175,0.1121,0.0383,-0.0281,-0.0484,-0.036,-0.0197,-0.068,-0.0826,-0.1317,0.1655,-0.2197,-0.0315,0.0177,0.0741,0.0061,0.1116,-0.0177,0.0547,-0.0874,-0.0601,0.0702,0.0668,0.1272,-0.065,0.0423,0.0399,-0.1282,0.0267,0.0644,-0.0956,0.0394,0.0211,-0.1286,0.1792,0.0512,0.0357,-0.033,0.0402,-0.0051,0.1778,0.0646,-0.0069,-0.1462,-0.0603,-0.0611,-0.1323,-0.0215,-0.0206,-0.1277,0.0381,-0.0176,-0.0063,-0.0638,0.1225,0.1097,-0.0754,-0.0069,0.0322,0.0801,0.0282,-0.0499,0.0627,0.0251,-0.0453,-0.0755,-0.2098,0.0308,-0.1508,0.1363,0.0408,-0.0291,-0.0854,0.0442,0.0312,-0.0384,-0.0673,-0.0343,-0.0641,0.0902,0.2055,-0.147,0.1914,0.0636,-0.0063,-0.1267,0.0785,0.0651,0.0274,-0.0407,0,0.0571,-0.0544,0.0697,0.0133,0.0381,0.0206,0.0684,-0.025,-0.1103,-0.0629,0.0554,0.1142,0.0002,0.0506,0.1176,0.0972,-0.0708,0.1803,-0.1181,0.0241,0.0626,-0.0169,0.0071,0.0863,0.0817,0.0302,0.0422,0.0653,0.1449,0.1287,0.0978,-0.0633,0.0295,0.0271,-0.0294,0.0436,0.0711,0.0105,0.1047,0.1296,0.0238,-0.1073,-0.157,0.0271,-0.0703,0.0383,-0.07,-0.0833,0.01,-0.0254,-0.0761,-0.0233,-0.0595,0.0727,0.0782,0.0596,0.0875,0.0015,0.1137,-0.0292,0.0372,0.0746,0.0386,-0.0116],"source":"design/codeStandards/settingsPageDesignGuidelines.md [chunk 5]","tags":["prd","design-guideline","what"],"version":1},

{"id":"settingsPageDesignGuidelines.md-chunk-8","text":"## Layout Guidelines\n\n- **Section Grouping with Fieldsets**  \n  Organize settings into logical sections using `<fieldset>` elements with descriptive `<legend>` titles. Each section (e.g. “Display Settings”, “General Settings”, “Game Modes”) should group related controls.  \n  _Example: The page currently has a “General Settings” fieldset for toggles like Sound, Navigation Map, and Motion._\n\n- **Consistent Form Structure**  \n  Use one `<form>` per section or a single form containing multiple `<fieldset>`s. Ensure consistency across all sections.\n\n- **Settings Item Container**  \n  Wrap each setting control in a `<div class=\"settings-item\">` for modularity and consistent spacing.\n\n- **Grid Layout for Controls**\n  Use the `.game-mode-toggle-container` class on fieldsets to enable responsive grid layouts:\n\n  - 3-column layout on desktop\n  - 1-column stacked layout on mobile\n  - The `Feature Flags` fieldset should include this class so flags display in a responsive grid.\n\n- **Responsive Design Preservation**  \n  New settings should stack vertically on mobile and arrange into columns on larger screens without breaking layout.\n\n- **Page Hierarchy**  \n  Maintain a logical top-down structure: main title `<h1>`, followed by fieldsets in an intuitive order (e.g. general → game-specific → advanced).\n\n- **Navigation and Tab Order**\n  Place controls in top-down, left-to-right order in the HTML to preserve logical keyboard navigation.\n\n### Settings Item Structure\n\nEach toggle or control should display a label followed by a short description.\nReuse the following markup for general settings, game modes, and feature flags:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"settings-item\">\n  <label for=\"example-toggle\">Example Toggle</label>\n  <p class=\"settings-description\">Explains what the option does.</p>\n</div>\n```\n\n---","qaContext":"Layout Guidelines - **Section Grouping with Fieldsets** Organize settings into logical sections using `<fieldset>` elements with descriptive `<legend>` titles.","embedding":[-0.0695,0.0496,-0.0427,0.0765,0.034,0.1233,-0.0018,0.0203,-0.1096,0.0063,-0.0141,0.0923,0.0608,-0.1026,0.123,0.0255,-0.1025,-0.0373,-0.1309,0.0038,0.0314,-0.1682,0.0749,-0.0667,-0.1727,0.1765,-0.0479,0.1139,-0.1225,-0.1158,0.0176,0.0986,-0.0767,0.0246,-0.0476,-0.0134,-0.0495,0.0526,-0.118,-0.0551,-0.1898,-0.0933,0.0419,0.0127,-0.053,0.0395,-0.2074,-0.1011,-0.0357,-0.0358,0.0254,0.0016,0.0879,0.0101,0.0829,0.0273,-0.0157,0.0752,0.0324,0.0389,0.0079,0.041,-0.0074,0.1103,-0.021,0.0583,-0.1193,-0.0068,-0.0448,0.0559,-0.1073,0.0121,0.1307,-0.0471,0.0202,-0.0127,-0.106,-0.0682,-0.1062,-0.0922,0.0928,0.1337,-0.0677,-0.0388,0.014,-0.1762,-0.0121,-0.0456,-0.0418,-0.0174,-0.1189,-0.16,0.1002,0.0556,-0.0588,0.0918,-0.0618,-0.2203,-0.0816,-0.0158,0.0314,-0.1063,0.1142,0.0722,0.022,-0.1569,-0.0872,0.1069,-0.0828,0.0812,0.0202,0.0866,-0.1938,-0.0252,-0.0148,0.0702,0.0908,0.0637,0.0976,0.0135,0.1824,-0.0026,-0.0849,-0.1347,0.1287,0.0453,-0.1029,0,0.1081,-0.0572,-0.1571,0.1368,0.1585,0.0209,0.016,0.1002,-0.0513,0.1837,0.0773,0.1341,-0.1844,0.071,0.0621,-0.1568,0.0449,0.1137,-0.0177,-0.1727,-0.0685,0.044,0.0226,-0.0579,0.1958,0.1423,-0.009,0.0611,-0.149,-0.033,-0.0126,-0.0531,0.0368,-0.0742,0.0552,0.0231,-0.0491,-0.0195,0.1045,0.0269,-0.0444,-0.1851,0.0588,-0.092,-0.044,0.0159,0.0845,0.0394,0.0759,-0.0751,0.0322,0.0057,-0.0568,-0.1843,0.1751,-0.1358,-0.1456,0.1234,0.1043,0.1292,0.1165,-0.0718,-0.0439,0.0025,-0.0027,0.0899,0.0858,-0.0766,0.0048,-0.123,-0.0869,0.0346,0.1339,-0.0206,0.0683,0.0061,-0.0938,-0.1162,-0.2147,-0.0027,-0.031,0.081,-0.0723,0.094,0.0204,-0.1328,0.1192,0,-0.1122,-0.1407,-0.143,0.0061,0.1211,-0.0632,0.0044,0,0.0045,0.0075,-0.0517,-0.0255,0.0802,0.0149,0.0923,0.1226,0.0472,0.0136,-0.0247,0.0213,-0.0484,-0.2216,-0.1958,0.1583,-0.1722,0.0482,0.0926,0.0459,-0.0445,0.0869,0.0012,0.1056,-0.0365,-0.1077,0.0621,0.0629,0.1069,0.086,0.0228,-0.0647,0.0293,0.002,0.0382,-0.0548,-0.0155,0.0269,-0.1098,0.1229,-0.0324,-0.0513,0.0154,-0.0542,-0.007,0.1028,0.1217,0.0348,-0.1348,-0.0502,-0.0281,-0.1644,-0.0538,-0.0721,-0.0072,0.0483,-0.0787,0.0045,-0.0799,-0.0334,0.1224,-0.0015,-0.1219,0.1161,0.1266,0.1296,-0.0556,-0.0855,0.0002,-0.0062,-0.1481,-0.1728,0.0527,-0.1629,0.0238,-0.0256,0.0585,-0.0884,0.0861,-0.0198,0.0406,-0.0614,-0.0577,-0.0852,-0.0512,0.1072,-0.1025,0.1332,0.0248,0.0327,-0.0627,0.0702,0.2118,0.0322,-0.0844,0,0.0519,-0.0679,0.0436,-0.129,-0.0617,-0.034,0.1063,-0.0009,-0.0418,0.0289,0.0951,0.1614,-0.0121,0.0122,0.0176,0.0577,-0.0569,0.2838,-0.0541,0.0703,0.1676,-0.011,-0.006,0.0872,0.0971,0.0486,-0.0991,-0.046,0.1643,0.0359,0.0887,-0.0737,0.0532,0.1,-0.0384,-0.0546,-0.0795,-0.0226,0.1559,0.1031,0.0534,-0.1677,-0.0863,0.0544,-0.0388,0.0674,-0.0352,0.0663,-0.0287,-0.0079,-0.1409,0.0646,0.0095,-0.1047,0.135,0.1048,0.0461,0.0943,0.1094,-0.1433,-0.0659,0.1864,-0.0257,-0.0265],"source":"design/codeStandards/settingsPageDesignGuidelines.md [chunk 8]","tags":["prd","design-guideline","what"],"version":1},

This pattern enhances accessibility and scalability as more settings are added.\n\n### Markup Example\n\n```html\n<div class=\"settings-section\">\n  <button\n    type=\"button\"\n    class=\"settings-section-toggle\"\n    aria-expanded=\"false\"\n    aria-controls=\"general-settings-content\"\n    id=\"general-settings-toggle\"\n  >\n    General Settings\n  </button>\n  <div\n    class=\"settings-section-content\"\n    id=\"general-settings-content\"\n    role=\"region\"\n    aria-labelledby=\"general-settings-toggle\"\n    hidden\n  >\n    <fieldset>...settings controls...</fieldset>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n- Repeat for each section (e.g., Game Modes).\n- The toggle button must be keyboard-focusable and operable (Enter/Space).\n- Toggle buttons must use `type=\"button\"` to avoid submitting the form.\n- Use `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, and `aria-labelledby` for accessibility.\n- The content div should be hidden by default (`hidden` attribute or `display: none;`).\n\n### Interaction & Accessibility\n\n- Clicking or pressing Enter/Space on the toggle expands/collapses the section and updates `aria-expanded`.\n- Only one or multiple sections may be open at a time (choose per UX needs).\n- All controls inside the section remain tabbable and accessible when expanded.\n- Use CSS transitions for smooth expand/collapse if desired.\n\n### Styling\n\n- Use `.settings-section`, `.settings-section-toggle`, and `.settings-section-content` classes for structure and styling.\n- Ensure toggle buttons and content meet touch target and contrast requirements.\n\n### Testing Checklist (add to existing)\n\n- [ ] Section toggles are keyboard and screen reader accessible\n- [ ] Collapsed sections hide content from screen readers and tab order\n- [ ] Expanding a section reveals its controls in tab order\n\n---\n\n","qaContext":"Collapsible Settings Sections (Recommended Pattern) To improve organization and reduce visual clutter, each major settings area (e.","embedding":[-0.0423,-0.0018,-0.0145,0.1509,0.0576,0.1363,0.1072,0.0478,-0.0967,0.0233,-0.017,0.06,0.0278,-0.1067,0.0978,-0.0263,-0.1091,-0.0419,-0.1081,-0.062,0.0776,-0.1551,0.0342,-0.0849,-0.1341,0.0826,-0.0747,0.0575,-0.1063,-0.1106,0.0106,0.0261,-0.0003,-0.029,-0.0261,-0.0707,-0.0136,-0.0282,-0.0435,-0.0313,-0.2521,-0.0655,0.0041,-0.0272,-0.0119,-0.043,-0.1901,-0.0525,0.034,-0.0237,0.0289,-0.0493,0.1164,0.0205,0.0001,-0.0014,-0.077,0.0249,-0.0003,0.0358,-0.0375,0.025,0.017,0.0705,-0.0095,0.1283,-0.0605,-0.1062,-0.0645,0.0591,-0.0581,0.0012,0.0509,-0.0397,-0.0054,-0.0968,-0.095,-0.0339,-0.0329,-0.0515,0.0084,0.0277,-0.1219,0.0213,-0.0516,-0.0188,0.0129,-0.0656,-0.075,-0.0575,-0.0549,-0.1109,0.0247,0.0391,-0.0283,-0.0048,0.0165,-0.1374,-0.0296,0.0384,-0.0262,-0.0723,0.0611,0.0275,-0.0139,-0.0439,-0.0218,0.0128,-0.1106,0.0955,0.0115,0.0651,-0.0702,-0.0217,-0.0043,0.076,0.1315,0.0575,0.124,0.0646,0.2381,0.0476,-0.1534,-0.0491,0.0832,0.0221,-0.075,0,0.1286,-0.1184,-0.1997,0.1284,0.111,0.0296,0.0974,0.0164,-0.1839,0.0662,0.0488,0.1426,-0.1585,-0.0257,0.1294,-0.1157,0.0856,0.1721,-0.0233,-0.1104,-0.0318,0.0909,0.0289,-0.0054,0.1131,0.1637,-0.0884,0.1012,-0.1388,0.014,0.0051,0.0072,-0.025,-0.0883,0.0178,-0.0303,-0.0441,0.0119,0.0909,0.0499,-0.0435,-0.1737,0.1337,-0.1481,-0.0704,0.0503,0.1415,0.0866,0.0398,-0.0878,0.0119,0.0606,-0.0904,-0.232,0.1251,-0.0948,-0.1546,0.0694,0.056,0.1508,0.0561,-0.0311,0.0228,0.0494,-0.0653,0.0693,0.0715,-0.0541,0.032,-0.1449,-0.1388,0.0727,0.166,-0.028,0.0364,-0.0616,-0.0432,-0.1327,-0.0978,-0.0684,0.0258,0.0214,-0.0937,0.0542,0.0279,-0.1043,0.116,0.0209,-0.1336,-0.1206,-0.131,-0.0546,0.0962,-0.1864,0.0257,0,0.0767,-0.0067,-0.0893,-0.0035,-0.0434,0.0452,0.1076,0.1252,0.065,-0.061,0.0044,0.0879,0.0185,-0.2065,-0.2363,0.1991,-0.1065,0.0612,-0.0045,0.0544,-0.0154,0.0016,-0.035,0.0316,0.0159,-0.0937,-0.0541,0.1184,0.1152,0.0199,0.0773,0.0474,-0.0794,0.0159,0.0142,-0.0838,-0.0755,0.0081,-0.0686,0.1072,0.051,-0.0201,0.0582,-0.0536,0.0019,0.2117,0.1102,0.0552,-0.1801,0.0169,-0.0077,-0.1895,-0.0869,-0.0445,0.0045,0.1142,-0.0223,-0.0736,-0.1071,0.0113,0.1382,-0.0207,-0.1148,0.1043,0.1177,0.0804,-0.0507,-0.0117,-0.0124,-0.0347,-0.063,-0.2287,0.1706,-0.1792,0.0479,0.0639,-0.035,-0.0398,0.0502,0.0441,0.014,-0.0731,-0.0605,-0.1638,0.0077,0.1472,-0.1625,0.1415,0.0319,0.0418,-0.1329,-0.0039,0.2343,-0.0151,-0.0663,0,0.0392,-0.0977,-0.045,-0.0695,-0.0181,-0.0374,0.0319,0.0336,-0.0484,-0.0114,0.0735,0.1147,0.0167,-0.0065,0.0162,0.1249,-0.0278,0.2309,-0.0519,0.0223,0.0535,-0.0536,-0.0015,0.0621,0.0865,0.0574,-0.1736,-0.019,0.1469,0.0629,0.1344,-0.0563,0.0177,0.1035,-0.0761,0.0146,0.0217,0.0434,0.0576,0.185,0.1314,-0.1859,-0.0793,0.0477,-0.1089,-0.0039,0.0224,0.0459,-0.0131,-0.0328,-0.0849,0.0443,0.0545,-0.052,0.1065,0.066,0.1038,0.1231,0.0385,-0.0273,-0.0294,0.1183,0.0104,0.0585],"source":"design/codeStandards/settingsPageDesignGuidelines.md [chunk 13]","tags":["prd","design-guideline","what"],"version":1},

For player-facing instructions see the [README section on Settings & Feature Flags](../../README.md#settings--feature-flags).\n\n### 🧩 Feature Flags – Implementation Guidelines\n\n- **Use Toggle Switch Pattern**  \n  Every feature flag should be implemented as a standard toggle using the existing `.switch` structure (see Styling Guidelines).\n\n- **ID and Naming Convention**  \n  Use predictable `id` and `name` values:\n\n  - ID format: `feature-<kebab-case-feature-name>`\n  - Name format: camelCase\n  - Example: `id=\"feature-random-stat-mode\" name=\"randomStatMode\"`\n  - Common example flags include `Battle Debug Panel`, `Full Navigation Map`, and `Card Inspector`\n\n- **ARIA and Accessibility**\n\n  - Provide `aria-label` for each feature flag\n  - Label must describe the feature clearly, even if experimental\n\n- **Persistence & Feedback**\n\n  - Use the `updateSetting()` pattern to store and reflect current flag states\n  - UI must reflect the saved state on load and provide immediate visual feedback on toggle\n\n- **Grouping**\n  - Place all feature flags in a dedicated `<fieldset>` titled `Feature Flags`\n  - For advanced/experimental features, nest under `Advanced Settings` with appropriate section toggling\n  - Markup example:\n    ```html\n    <div class=\"settings-section\">\n      <button type=\"button\" class=\"settings-section-toggle\" id=\"advanced-settings-toggle\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"advanced-settings-content\">Advanced Settings</button>\n      <div class=\"settings-section-content\" id=\"advanced-settings-content\" role=\"region\" aria-labelledby=\"advanced-settings-toggle\" hidden>\n        ","qaContext":"Feature Flags & Agent Observability To support AI-assisted testing, variant gameplay modes, and scalable development, JU-DO-KON!","embedding":[-0.0444,0.0434,-0.0016,0.0787,0.0337,0.0797,0.0364,0.0201,-0.1641,0.0023,0.0147,-0.1019,-0.0157,-0.0606,0.1113,0.0874,0.0697,-0.0314,-0.0097,-0.0407,0.0425,-0.1567,0.0527,-0.0381,-0.1499,0.0989,0.0208,0.0049,-0.0953,-0.0996,0.0501,0.0946,-0.1482,-0.0738,0.0032,-0.0633,-0.1323,-0.0435,-0.0193,-0.0565,-0.0783,-0.0285,-0.0775,-0.0724,-0.0232,-0.0398,-0.0973,-0.0638,-0.0053,-0.0762,-0.0151,-0.0516,0.1394,-0.0364,0.1122,-0.015,-0.0057,0.1287,0.0918,-0.0018,0.0093,-0.0024,0.0513,0.0725,0.0147,0.0674,-0.0235,-0.0656,0.0362,0.0062,-0.1226,0.0567,0.0696,-0.0075,0.0695,0.0233,-0.1167,-0.0003,0.0738,-0.1517,-0.0742,-0.0247,-0.1036,0.0044,0.0195,-0.0142,0.0586,-0.0744,0.0536,-0.0375,0.0147,-0.0938,0.0309,-0.0626,-0.0504,0.0278,-0.0151,-0.0041,-0.0857,0.0662,0.0251,-0.0416,0.0544,0.1081,0.0195,-0.1019,0.0718,0.0041,-0.0413,0.0528,0.0041,0.0945,0.0238,-0.0887,0.0348,0.0629,0.0965,0.0789,0.1158,0.0691,0.2179,-0.0681,-0.0509,-0.0492,0.1244,0.1612,-0.0498,0,0.212,-0.1282,-0.1263,0.0269,0.0464,-0.0387,0.0899,0.0238,-0.1405,0.0735,-0.0265,0.0979,-0.1342,0.0138,0.089,-0.0368,-0.0614,-0.0225,0.0146,-0.0994,0.0797,-0.0767,-0.0327,0.0429,0.0717,0.0904,-0.0094,-0.0048,-0.1576,0.0724,0.0419,-0.004,-0.0662,0.0599,-0.1548,-0.0302,-0.1242,-0.008,0.0278,0.0426,0.0093,-0.135,0.0005,-0.0882,-0.0366,-0.0362,0.0287,0.0062,0.1054,-0.0278,0.0584,-0.0273,0.0413,-0.1358,0.1256,-0.0065,0.0195,0.0293,0.0108,0.1292,-0.0736,0.0002,-0.0182,0.0374,-0.0254,0.1378,0.0453,-0.0631,-0.0023,-0.1129,-0.1436,0.0517,0.0694,-0.0313,-0.041,-0.1117,-0.0353,-0.0996,-0.1152,-0.0711,0.1126,0.0015,-0.1027,0.139,0.1404,-0.1567,-0.013,0.0015,-0.1561,-0.0453,0.0264,0.0046,0.0848,-0.056,-0.0436,0,-0.0009,-0.0296,-0.0067,0.0811,-0.0258,-0.0092,0.1099,0.0458,-0.0137,-0.0217,-0.0329,-0.0781,-0.0729,-0.0743,-0.0962,0.1399,-0.2264,0.0113,0.0602,0.0849,-0.0114,0.1325,-0.0361,0.0585,-0.0997,-0.0697,0.0403,0.0884,0.1023,-0.0666,0.021,0.0339,-0.1599,0.0407,0.0325,-0.0831,0.0372,0.0328,-0.1072,0.1484,-0.0131,-0.0182,-0.0389,0.0544,-0.0021,0.156,0.0775,-0.0089,-0.1509,-0.0398,-0.0836,-0.0963,-0.0099,0.0038,-0.1253,0.0193,-0.0245,-0.0162,-0.0837,0.1602,0.1071,-0.1142,0.0213,0.0637,0.0602,0.0248,-0.043,0.1014,0.0634,-0.0644,-0.0456,-0.2054,0.0497,-0.1476,0.144,0.0024,-0.0679,-0.1024,0.0625,0.0458,-0.0622,-0.0782,-0.0538,-0.1297,0.0523,0.1775,-0.1705,0.195,0.0508,0.0101,-0.1432,0.08,0.086,0.0407,-0.0566,0,0.0818,-0.0586,0.0912,0.0372,0.0383,0.0476,0.0333,-0.0071,-0.1266,-0.0829,0.0927,0.1179,0.0107,0.1069,0.1004,0.0128,-0.0961,0.2115,-0.0945,0.0465,0.0561,-0.0299,0.0254,0.0553,0.0841,-0.0062,0.0188,0.0618,0.144,0.115,0.0499,-0.0657,0.0875,0.0841,-0.0725,0.0576,0.0127,0.0114,0.087,0.0821,0.0194,-0.1192,-0.173,0.0466,-0.0672,0.0343,-0.0304,-0.0509,0.0523,-0.0186,-0.0727,-0.0272,-0.0449,0.0637,0.1166,0.0795,0.0748,-0.0047,0.1113,-0.0045,0.031,0.0246,-0.0156,-0.0307],"source":"design/codeStandards/settingsPageDesignGuidelines.md [chunk 19]","tags":["prd","design-guideline","what"],"version":1},

{"id":"prdRulesForAgents.md-chunk-1","text":"# JU-DO-KON! PRD Guidelines\n\nThis document summarizes the **required structure and content** for high-quality Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) in the JU-DO-KON! project. All PRDs live under `design/productRequirementsDocuments` and follow a common pattern. In addition to general sections like **Overview**, **Problem Statement**, **Goals**, **User Stories**, **Non-goals**, etc., _each PRD must explicitly list its functional requirements and corresponding acceptance criteria_. These sections enable AI agents to check completeness and correctness of new PRDs.\n\n## Required Sections and Structure\n\nA good PRD typically includes at least the following sections:\n\n- **Title/Overview (TL;DR)** – A brief summary of the feature or mode and its purpose. Example: the Classic Battle PRD starts with “Classic Battle is Ju-Do-Kon!’s introductory, head-to-head mode…”.\n- **Problem Statement / Why It Matters** – A clear statement of the user problem or gap this feature addresses, often supported by user feedback. For example, the Browse Judoka PRD has a “Problem Statement” section explaining players’ frustration at not seeing all judoka at once.\n- **Goals / Success Metrics** – Quantitative (e.g. KPI targets) and qualitative goals that justify the feature. The Game Modes overview PRD lists KPI targets (e.g. “Increase returning player session length by 20%”) and player experience goals.\n- **User Stories** – Persona-driven scenarios that describe how different users will use the feature. Each PRD we checked includes user stories with format “As a \\[user], I want \\[action] so that \\[outcome]”.\n- **Functional Requirements (Prioritized)** – _A prioritized list/table of all required features or functions_.

{"id":"prdRulesForAgents.md-chunk-2","text":"Description**. For example, the Classic Battle PRD has a “Prioritized Functional Requirements” table listing P1/P2/P3 features, and the Browse Judoka PRD lists its features similarly. Each entry should be concise but descriptive of the expected behavior.\n- **Acceptance Criteria** – _Specific, testable conditions_ that defines each functional requirement. These are often bullet points under an “Acceptance Criteria” heading. For instance, the Browse Judoka PRD includes criteria like “The full list of up to 100 judoka cards loads and is visible within 1 second” or “Using keyboard arrow keys moves focus to the previous/next card”. Likewise, the Classic Battle PRD lists criteria such as “Cards are revealed in the correct sequence each round” and “Player can select a stat within 30 seconds; if not, the system auto-selects”. Each criterion should be measurable or verifiable (e.g. time limits, UI states, error handling).\n- **Non-Functional Requirements / Design Considerations** – Accessibility, performance, UX rules, etc. (e.g. “≥30 fps during scrolling”). These ensure quality beyond functionality.\n- **Dependencies and Open Questions** – Any external modules used or design decisions pending (e.g. the Team Battle rules PRD lists dependencies on the Classic Battle logic).\n\nBy organizing PRDs this way, AI agents (and human reviewers) can quickly verify completeness. For example, a missing “Acceptance Criteria” section or an unprioritized requirements list can be flagged as a gap.\n\n## Prioritized Functional Requirements\n\n- **Use a clear table or list:** Each functional requirement should appear with a _priority level_ (e.g. P1, P2, P3) and a brief description. In JU-DO-KON PRDs, priorities are usually **P1** (must-have), **P2** (important), **P3** (nice-to-have).\n- **Be concise and descriptive:** The “Feature” column names the requirement, and “Description” explains it.

{"id":"prdRulesForAgents.md-chunk-3","text":"le, one entry is **“P1 – Random Card Draw: Draw one random card per player each round…”**. Another is **“P1 – Scrollable Card Interface: Allow players to scroll through the full judoka roster.”**.\n- **Cover all core behaviors:** Every major mode or feature should have its key functions listed. In the Game Modes PRD, a single table lists high-level features for all modes (e.g. Classic Battle, Team Battle Modes, etc.). In a mode-specific PRD (like Classic Battle), list all game mechanics (card draw, scoring, end conditions) as separate entries.\n- **Include additional details if needed:** After the main table, PRDs sometimes include further behavioral notes. E.g., the Classic Battle PRD adds bullet points on tie handling and start conditions. This is optional but can clarify nuanced rules.\n\n> _Example:_ The Classic Battle PRD’s prioritized requirements table lists P1 items like “Random Card Draw,” “Stat Selection Timer,” “Scoring,” and “Match End Condition” with clear descriptions. An AI should expect to see a similar table (or structured list) in any new PRD.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- **One entry per requirement or scenario:** Each criterion states a condition that can be _tested_ or observed. Ideally, every P1/P2 feature has at least one acceptance criterion. For example, the Classic Battle PRD pairs its “Stat Selection Timer” requirement with “Player can select a stat within 30 seconds; if not, the system auto-selects a random stat”.\n- **Write testable statements:** Use clear language and measurable terms.

For instance, several PRDs check for JSON load failures (“display an error message if judoka.json fails to load”) or empty data cases. The Classic Battle PRD even specifies behavior on ties (“If the selected stats are equal, a tie message displays”).\n- **Use consistent format:** In JU-DO-KON docs, acceptance criteria are bullet points under a heading like “## Acceptance Criteria”. Each bullet starts with a hyphen and is written in present-tense imperative (e.g. “Cards are revealed…”, “Player can quit…”).\n\n> _Example:_ In the Browse Judoka PRD, acceptance bullets include statements like “If judoka.json has an invalid entry, show a default placeholder card” and “Using keyboard arrow keys moves focus to the next card”. These directly correspond to the features (e.g. data binding, accessibility) and are easily checkable.\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n- **Clarity and Completeness:** A high-quality PRD uses precise wording (no vague terms) and ensures nothing important is omitted. For example, it’s good practice to reference related PRDs (as in “See PRD: Team Battle Rules”) and to link dependencies.\n- **Consistency:** Use similar section headings and formatting across PRDs. The existing docs use headings like `## Goals`, `## User Stories`, `## Functional Requirements`, `## Acceptance Criteria`, etc. Replicating these will help agents reliably parse and compare documents.\n- **Examples from the codebase:** The Classic Battle PRD (design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdClassicBattle.md) and Browse Judoka PRD (prdBrowseJudoka.md) are good models. Both include a prioritized requirements table followed by a bullet-list of acceptance criteria. AI agents can compare a new PRD against these examples to see if key elements are present.\n\nIn summary, **every PRD should spell out its features and how they will be validated**.

{"id":"prdRulesForAgents.md-chunk-6","text":"## Required Sections and Structure\n\nA good PRD typically includes at least the following sections:\n\n- **Title/Overview (TL;DR)** – A brief summary of the feature or mode and its purpose. Example: the Classic Battle PRD starts with “Classic Battle is Ju-Do-Kon!’s introductory, head-to-head mode…”.\n- **Problem Statement / Why It Matters** – A clear statement of the user problem or gap this feature addresses, often supported by user feedback. For example, the Browse Judoka PRD has a “Problem Statement” section explaining players’ frustration at not seeing all judoka at once.\n- **Goals / Success Metrics** – Quantitative (e.g. KPI targets) and qualitative goals that justify the feature. The Game Modes overview PRD lists KPI targets (e.g. “Increase returning player session length by 20%”) and player experience goals.\n- **User Stories** – Persona-driven scenarios that describe how different users will use the feature. Each PRD we checked includes user stories with format “As a \\[user], I want \\[action] so that \\[outcome]”.\n- **Functional Requirements (Prioritized)** – _A prioritized list/table of all required features or functions_. This is critical: it enumerates _what the feature must do_, along with a priority for each item. Typically this is presented as a table with columns like **Priority**, **Feature**, and **Description**. For example, the Classic Battle PRD has a “Prioritized Functional Requirements” table listing P1/P2/P3 features, and the Browse Judoka PRD lists its features similarly. Each entry should be concise but descriptive of the expected behavior.\n- **Acceptance Criteria** – _Specific, testable conditions_ that defines each functional requirement. These are often bullet points under an “Acceptance Criteria” heading. For instance, the Browse Judoka PRD includes criteria like “The full list of up to 100 judoka cards loads and is visible within 1 second” or “Using keyboard arrow keys moves focus to the previous/next card”.

In JU-DO-KON PRDs, priorities are usually **P1** (must-have), **P2** (important), **P3** (nice-to-have).\n- **Be concise and descriptive:** The “Feature” column names the requirement, and “Description” explains it. For example, one entry is **“P1 – Random Card Draw: Draw one random card per player each round…”**. Another is **“P1 – Scrollable Card Interface: Allow players to scroll through the full judoka roster.”**.\n- **Cover all core behaviors:** Every major mode or feature should have its key functions listed. In the Game Modes PRD, a single table lists high-level features for all modes (e.g. Classic Battle, Team Battle Modes, etc.). In a mode-specific PRD (like Classic Battle), list all game mechanics (card draw, scoring, end conditions) as separate entries.\n- **Include additional details if needed:** After the main table, PRDs sometimes include further behavioral notes. E.g., the Classic Battle PRD adds bullet points on tie handling and start conditions. This is optional but can clarify nuanced rules.\n\n> _Example:_ The Classic Battle PRD’s prioritized requirements table lists P1 items like “Random Card Draw,” “Stat Selection Timer,” “Scoring,” and “Match End Condition” with clear descriptions.

{"id":"prdRulesForAgents.md-chunk-9","text":"## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- **One entry per requirement or scenario:** Each criterion states a condition that can be _tested_ or observed. Ideally, every P1/P2 feature has at least one acceptance criterion. For example, the Classic Battle PRD pairs its “Stat Selection Timer” requirement with “Player can select a stat within 30 seconds; if not, the system auto-selects a random stat”.\n- **Write testable statements:** Use clear language and measurable terms. Good criteria use specific numbers or UI actions (e.g. “loads within 1 second,” “score updates correctly,” “error message appears if…”). The Browse Judoka PRD requires, “The full list of up to 100 judoka cards loads and is visible within 1 second” and “Scrolling rapidly through the card carousel maintains ≥30 fps”.\n- **Cover success and failure cases:** Include criteria for normal operation _and_ error states. For instance, several PRDs check for JSON load failures (“display an error message if judoka.json fails to load”) or empty data cases. The Classic Battle PRD even specifies behavior on ties (“If the selected stats are equal, a tie message displays”).\n- **Use consistent format:** In JU-DO-KON docs, acceptance criteria are bullet points under a heading like “## Acceptance Criteria”. Each bullet starts with a hyphen and is written in present-tense imperative (e.g. “Cards are revealed…”, “Player can quit…”).\n\n> _Example:_ In the Browse Judoka PRD, acceptance bullets include statements like “If judoka.json has an invalid entry, show a default placeholder card” and “Using keyboard arrow keys moves focus to the next card”. These directly correspond to the features (e.g. data binding, accessibility) and are easily checkable.","qaContext":"Acceptance Criteria - **One entry per requirement or scenario:** Each criterion states a condition that can be _tested_ or observed.","embedding":[-0.1519,0.1506,-0.0608,0.0192,-0.0408,0.0444,0.0896,0.0703,0.066,-0.0161,0.0636,-0.0766,0.1074,0.0713,0.0522,-0.0686,0.0832,0.0241,-0.0495,0.0377,0.0843,-0.0581,0.0208,-0.0191,-0.1098,0.0157,-0.039,-0.0017,-0.099,0.0147,-0.0396,0.0955,0.0416,0.0304,0.0655,-0.017,-0.0897,-0.0386,-0.1159,0.0204,-0.0863,-0.0561,-0.0269,0.0747,0.1499,-0.0819,-0.0852,0.0098,-0.0393,0.0461,-0.1607,0.0103,0.1234,-0.0114,0.0959,-0.0285,0.0129,-0.0652,-0.0265,-0.0051,0.0104,-0.0736,-0.118,0.0817,-0.0068,-0.088,-0.0066,0.0532,0.0361,0.0522,-0.0718,0.0633,-0.1009,0.1048,-0.001,0.0867,0.0045,-0.0918,-0.0083,-0.1616,-0.1046,-0.0516,0.0054,-0.0008,0.1317,0.0103,0.1423,0.046,0.0404,0.0505,0.0883,0.0466,-0.0215,0.0466,0.0609,0.0352,-0.0709,0.0006,-0.0162,0.1223,-0.0086,0.0282,0.1048,0,0.0013,-0.1032,0.0356,-0.0317,0.0125,-0.0492,-0.0434,-0.0308,0.0221,-0.0618,-0.0154,0.1215,-0.0527,0.055,0.0542,0.033,0.069,-0.0543,-0.0005,-0.0355,0.0828,0.0186,-0.0172,0,0.024,-0.1792,-0.0619,0.0074,-0.1132,-0.0834,-0.0506,-0.1367,-0.0236,0.0343,-0.0246,0.1307,-0.0536,-0.0046,0.1173,0.0121,-0.0946,0.1058,-0.0106,0.0629,0.1906,-0.1118,-0.0175,-0.0164,0.0552,0.2011,0.0136,-0.0221,-0.0275,0.0668,0.0367,-0.1483,-0.1075,-0.0699,-0.0745,-0.0295,-0.005,-0.0319,-0.0208,-0.0268,-0.1396,-0.0888,-0.025,0.0173,-0.0085,-0.1458,-0.0918,0.0535,0.035,0.1382,-0.0263,0.0587,0.1017,-0.0005,-0.0206,-0.0357,0.0449,0.0539,-0.034,0.0938,-0.0263,0.0332,-0.1536,0.0495,0.018,0.0884,-0.1018,-0.0862,0.0826,-0.0372,-0.098,0.0187,-0.0076,-0.0569,0.0046,-0.2065,0.0646,0.0975,-0.0862,-0.0621,-0.0618,-0.0544,-0.1404,0.0859,-0.0105,0.0613,0.0675,-0.1015,-0.2209,-0.0007,0.0663,0.1054,-0.0501,0.0866,0.0659,0,-0.0034,0.0108,0.0374,0.1294,0.0354,-0.037,0.0527,0.0733,0.1281,-0.1638,-0.0376,-0.0372,-0.0272,-0.0133,-0.0675,0.0309,-0.1001,-0.0159,-0.1186,0.1371,0.137,0.1495,-0.0393,0.0119,-0.0626,0.0182,0.0786,-0.1067,-0.0925,-0.032,0.0581,-0.0635,-0.2113,0.178,-0.0017,-0.1663,0.0953,0.0064,-0.0006,0.2478,0.1457,0.0359,-0.1261,0.0932,-0.0364,0.0642,0.0145,0.0117,0.0338,-0.0863,-0.0297,0.0507,0.0529,0.002,-0.0767,-0.0258,-0.0282,-0.1179,-0.0636,0.1108,-0.0389,-0.0151,0.0472,0.0319,0.0727,-0.0881,-0.0364,0.039,0.0061,0.0004,-0.0918,0.0028,-0.0404,-0.0355,0.0952,0.0393,-0.0885,0.0653,0.0568,0.0581,-0.0746,0.0837,-0.0354,0.009,0.0641,0.1949,-0.0307,-0.0027,0.1093,0.0087,0.0513,0.078,0.1664,0.1213,-0.0762,0,-0.0981,-0.0681,0.0241,0.0562,0.0645,0.0465,-0.0689,-0.1029,-0.0958,-0.0781,0.2314,0.2394,-0.1572,-0.0748,0.0158,-0.0125,0.0203,0.0607,-0.1095,0.0148,0.0515,-0.1001,-0.0367,0.0423,-0.0973,-0.0048,-0.0279,0.0408,-0.0091,-0.0667,0.0677,-0.061,-0.0289,0.0272,0.0043,0.1391,0.0292,0.0241,0.0083,0.1092,-0.0597,-0.1254,-0.0296,-0.0024,-0.0161,0.0383,-0.1382,-0.1728,-0.0242,-0.1419,-0.0382,-0.1701,-0.0433,0.0014,-0.0272,0.1654,0.1641,-0.0693,-0.0113,0.0156,0.1478,0.0522,-0.0586,0.0759],"source":"design/codeStandards/prdRulesForAgents.md [chunk 9]","tags":["prd","design-guideline","how"],"version":1},
{"id":"prdRulesForAgents.md-chunk-10","text":"## Additional Notes\n\n- **Clarity and Completeness:** A high-quality PRD uses precise wording (no vague terms) and ensures nothing important is omitted. For example, it’s good practice to reference related PRDs (as in “See PRD: Team Battle Rules”) and to link dependencies.\n- **Consistency:** Use similar section headings and formatting across PRDs. The existing docs use headings like `## Goals`, `## User Stories`, `## Functional Requirements`, `## Acceptance Criteria`, etc. Replicating these will help agents reliably parse and compare documents.\n- **Examples from the codebase:** The Classic Battle PRD (design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdClassicBattle.md) and Browse Judoka PRD (prdBrowseJudoka.md) are good models. Both include a prioritized requirements table followed by a bullet-list of acceptance criteria. AI agents can compare a new PRD against these examples to see if key elements are present.\n\nIn summary, **every PRD should spell out its features and how they will be validated**. Check that each functional requirement has an assigned priority and clear description (as in \\[33†L55-L64]), and that each has corresponding acceptance criteria (as in \\[36†L69-L76]). Missing any of these components indicates a gap in the document. By following these guidelines, AI agents can systematically evaluate PRDs for completeness and readiness for implementation.\n\n**Sources:** Examples and patterns drawn from JU-DO-KON PRDs in `design/productRequirementsDocuments`.

{"id":"codeUIDesignStandards.md-chunk-1","text":"# Ju-Do-Kon! UI Design Standards\n\nThis unified design guide is for developers, designers, and PMs building **Ju-Do-Kon!**, the web-based judo-themed collectible card game. It combines visual identity, interaction design, and component rules into a single reference.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis document defines the **visual identity**, **component rules**, and **interaction principles** used throughout Ju-Do-Kon!'s user interface. It ensures the experience is:\n\n- Visually consistent\n- Game-appropriate for ages 8–12\n- Optimised for both desktop and mobile\n- Scalable and maintainable for future features\n\n---\n\n## 2. Design Language\n\n### 2.1 Overview\n\nJu-Do-Kon! uses a **bold, high-contrast design system** grounded in clear hierarchy, playful colour, and expressive character visuals.\n\n#### Key Visual Themes\n\n- Flat colour + geometric background textures\n- Layered judoka cards\n- Emphasis typography (caps, bold, white-on-colour)\n- Panelled layout with z-depth and modular sections\n\n### 2.2 Design Principles\n\n- **Touch-first Interaction** – Minimum 48x48px targets, swipeable areas, and tap feedback (see sizing tokens in [Tokens](#10-tokens)).\n- **Responsive Feedback** – Every interaction must give feedback (scale, glow, ripple, animation).\n- **Visual Hierarchy** – Layout must surface the most important info and reinforce progression.\n- **Progressive Disclosure** – Show only essential actions up front; reveal detail as needed.\n- **Consistency** – Reuse shared UI patterns to improve familiarity.\n- **Accessibility** – WCAG AA, keyboard navigation, screen reader support.\n- **Continuity** – Layout and navigation must remain familiar across breakpoints.\n- **Momentum** – Game flow must feel lively and animated.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

{"id":"codePseudocodeStandards.md-chunk-1","text":"# Pseudocode Description Standards\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nClear pseudocode descriptions are essential for explaining the underlying logic and structure of complex code. They provide high-level insight into the intended workflow, enabling better collaboration, easier debugging, and faster onboarding of new developers. Without detailed pseudocode, complex functions and workflows become opaque and harder to maintain.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n- **Clarity**: Ensure that code logic is easy to grasp through structured pseudocode.\n- **Maintainability**: Keep pseudocode descriptions updated as logic evolves.\n- **Consistency**: Apply a uniform approach to pseudocode formatting.\n- **Knowledge Transfer**: Enable developers to understand the logical flow without reading every line of code.\n\n---\n\n## Standards\n\n### Pseudocode Standards\n\n- Provide high-level pseudocode comments above logical blocks.\n- Use the `@pseudocode` marker at the beginning of pseudocode blocks to distinguish them from other comments.\n- Explain **why** the code is performing certain actions, not just **what** it is doing.\n- Use a clear, step-by-step, numbered list format for pseudocode within documentation blocks.\n- Maintain concise and grammatically correct language.\n- Use an imperative style (\"Initialize\", \"Render\", \"Handle\", etc.).\n- Avoid restating code line-by-line — focus on logical operations and workflows.\n- Place pseudocode only where it adds value, especially for complex functions and workflows.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * Populates the bottom navigation bar with game modes from JSON files.\n *\n * @pseudocode\n * 1. Load mode definitions using `loadGameModes()` (reads `gameModes.json`).\n * 2.

{"id":"codePseudocodeStandards.md-chunk-6","text":"## Standards\n\n### Pseudocode Standards\n\n- Provide high-level pseudocode comments above logical blocks.\n- Use the `@pseudocode` marker at the beginning of pseudocode blocks to distinguish them from other comments.\n- Explain **why** the code is performing certain actions, not just **what** it is doing.\n- Use a clear, step-by-step, numbered list format for pseudocode within documentation blocks.\n- Maintain concise and grammatically correct language.\n- Use an imperative style (\"Initialize\", \"Render\", \"Handle\", etc.).\n- Avoid restating code line-by-line — focus on logical operations and workflows.\n- Place pseudocode only where it adds value, especially for complex functions and workflows.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * Populates the bottom navigation bar with game modes from JSON files.\n *\n * @pseudocode\n * 1. Load mode definitions using `loadGameModes()` (reads `gameModes.json`).\n * 2. Fetch `navigationItems.json` for display order and visibility flags.\n *    - If either fetch fails, log an error and show a fallback message.\n * 3. Merge navigation items with mode data by matching the `id` field.\n * 4. Filter out items where `isHidden` is true and keep only main menu entries.\n * 5. Sort the remaining items by their `order` value.\n * 6. Generate HTML list items for each merged object.\n * 7. Update the navigation bar with the generated HTML.\n * 8. Handle any errors during the process gracefully.\n */\nfunction populateNavigationBar() { ... }\n```\n\n### Additional Examples\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * Fetches data from an API with proper error handling.\n *\n * @pseudocode\n * 1. Send an HTTP GET request to the desired API endpoint.\n *    - If the request fails, log the error and return a fallback value.\n *\n * 2.

Poor documentation leads to reduced development velocity, increased technical debt, and greater risk of introducing defects.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n- **Readability**: Ensure that code is easy to understand through clear JSDoc documentation.\n- **Maintainability**: Keep JSDoc comments accurate and up-to-date alongside code changes.\n- **Consistency**: Apply a uniform style and structure for all JSDoc comments.\n- **Knowledge Transfer**: Enable new developers to comprehend codebase logic and intent quickly.\n\n---\n\n## Standards\n\n### JSDoc Standards\n\n- Use block comments `/** ... */` for all public functions, classes, and modules.\n- Start with a brief, single-sentence summary describing the function’s purpose.\n- Document each parameter with `@param`, specifying:\n  - Parameter type using `{Type}` syntax.\n  - Parameter name.\n  - Brief description.\n- Document the return value with `@returns`, specifying:\n  - Return type.\n  - Brief description.\n- Indicate optional parameters with square brackets, e.g., `@param {string} [optionalParam]`.\n- Mention default values in the parameter description if applicable.\n- Always match documentation with the actual function signature.\n- **Do not modify or remove any comments marked with `@pseudocode`.** These are high-level logical descriptions and must remain intact to preserve the intent and structure of the code.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * Build the card carousel HTML elements.\n * @param {Array<Object>} cards - Array of card data to be displayed.\n * @param {HTMLElement} container - The DOM element where carousel will be injected.\n * @returns {void}\n */\nfunction buildCarousel(cards, container) { ... }\n```\n\n---\n\n## Language an","qaContext":"JSDoc Commenting Standards ## Problem Statement Clear and consistent JSDoc documentation is essential for maintaining code quality, facilitating collaboratio...","embedding":[-0.1815,0.0875,-0.0417,0.0326,0.0315,-0.0309,0.0236,0.091,-0.1038,-0.1086,-0.0018,0.0043,-0.0406,-0.0451,0.0963,0.1486,0.0248,-0.0347,-0.109,-0.0043,0.1451,-0.0668,-0.0197,0.0523,-0.0602,0.1162,0.0251,0.009,-0.1153,0.0424,-0.0725,0.0635,0.0843,0.049,0.0479,0.1384,-0.049,-0.1259,-0.0091,-0.1081,-0.2098,0.0164,-0.0501,-0.0539,0.014,-0.1224,-0.1034,-0.1286,-0.1043,0.0376,-0.1551,-0.0871,-0.0269,-0.1827,-0.0295,0.0061,-0.0474,-0.0095,-0.0153,-0.0369,0.0017,0.0542,0.0388,0.139,-0.0129,-0.1169,-0.0666,0.0387,-0.0121,0.1599,-0.1344,0.1369,0.1228,0.0515,0.0021,0.0481,-0.0425,0.0587,-0.0165,-0.1821,0.0151,-0.0331,-0.049,0.065,0.0333,0.0535,0.1298,0.076,0.0757,-0.0189,0.0115,-0.1172,0.0665,-0.0405,-0.0002,0.0419,0.0414,-0.1501,-0.1274,0.1385,-0.0213,0.1677,0.1789,-0.0879,0.0391,0.0797,-0.0625,0.0759,-0.0612,-0.0445,-0.0759,0.0909,-0.1628,-0.156,-0.0159,-0.0922,0.0765,-0.1145,0.1324,0.1393,0.2624,0.0134,-0.0461,0.0744,0.0625,-0.0266,-0.0414,0,0.0791,-0.0258,0.0205,0.1295,-0.0071,-0.0164,0.0564,0.015,-0.1744,0.0605,0.1056,0.0001,-0.0051,0.0753,-0.0055,-0.0528,-0.0086,0.0621,0.1092,0.0063,0.0033,-0.0525,0.0093,-0.0216,-0.007,0.1145,0.0182,0.0068,-0.1041,0.023,0.0797,-0.0698,-0.0565,0.0655,0.1181,0.0383,-0.0668,-0.124,0.0344,-0.0533,-0.0788,-0.04,-0.1068,-0.0403,0.0477,-0.0281,0.048,0.0533,0.0446,0.0802,-0.1404,0.0643,0.0556,0.0118,0.0711,-0.1759,0.0458,0.0432,-0.0531,-0.0017,-0.0468,0.0772,-0.147,-0.0401,-0.0207,0.0061,-0.0749,0.0364,0.0037,-0.1224,0.0012,-0.0045,0.0872,0.0318,-0.0826,-0.0588,-0.0662,-0.0963,-0.085,-0.1477,-0.0365,-0.0308,-0.0943,0.0099,0.0526,0.0451,0.1327,-0.0301,-0.039,0.0763,0.0647,0.0231,-0.0713,-0.1059,0.044,0,0.0557,0.0807,-0.1285,0.029,-0.0908,-0.0653,-0.0143,0.0655,0.0728,-0.1209,-0.0831,0.015,-0.0668,-0.09,-0.0093,0.0928,-0.1746,-0.1075,0.056,0.0722,0.1254,0.1432,0.0772,0.0171,-0.0592,-0.0238,0.0665,0.1122,-0.0022,-0.0778,0.0917,0.0024,-0.0949,0.0361,0.0607,-0.1544,0.0044,0.0145,-0.005,0.0215,0.0658,-0.1021,-0.0204,-0.0457,-0.0141,-0.0094,0.036,0.1195,0.006,-0.1192,-0.1877,-0.2787,-0.0694,-0.0752,-0.0212,0.0145,0.0147,-0.0542,0.0207,0.0141,-0.0285,0.0016,0.0454,-0.0837,0.0427,-0.1286,-0.0155,0.0056,-0.06,0.0327,-0.0655,-0.0052,-0.0107,-0.0639,0.0161,-0.0484,0.0975,-0.1309,0.0385,-0.0116,0.0159,0.0591,0.0191,-0.0059,0.0344,0.0236,-0.0669,0.0792,-0.0731,-0.0681,-0.0547,0.1329,0.1423,0.0261,-0.0949,0,-0.1057,-0.1353,-0.1379,-0.0373,-0.0128,-0.0273,0.0494,0.0345,-0.0684,-0.022,0.2239,0.1858,-0.0243,0.0645,-0.0387,0.0256,-0.0298,0.1579,-0.0867,0.001,0.0277,-0.0724,-0.0114,-0.0073,0.1038,-0.0306,0.0635,0.1143,-0.001,0.0004,-0.01,0.0235,0.1332,-0.0023,0.0951,-0.0163,0.0992,0.0913,0.1027,0.0654,0.0146,0.1359,-0.1906,0.0685,0.116,0.0302,-0.1072,0.0407,-0.0491,-0.0926,-0.1244,-0.0312,-0.1306,0.0111,0.0033,0.0232,0.0535,0.0748,0.069,0.0781,0.0076,0.1238,0.0826,0.0137],"source":"design/codeStandards/codeJSDocStandards.md [chunk 1]","tags":["prd","design-guideline","why"],"version":1},

{"id":"exampleVectorQueries.md-chunk-1","text":"# Example Vector Queries\n\nThis document shows how AI agents can search the JU-DO-KON! vector database and provides prompt templates for common workflows.\n\n## Embedding JSON Format\n\nEmbeddings are stored in `client_embeddings.json` as an array of objects. Each entry includes the original text along with metadata for retrieval. JSON arrays or objects (for example, tooltip sets or judoka data) are broken apart so every record gets its own vector. **The `embedding` field must be a flat numeric array (e.g. `[0.12, -0.04, ...]`) rather than an object with `dims` or `data`.**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"prdClassicBattle.md#overview\",\n  \"text\": \"Classic Battle is Ju-Do-Kon!'s introductory mode...\",\n  \"qaContext\": \"Classic Battle introduces the game's basic one-on-one mode.\",\n  \"embedding\": [0.12, -0.04, 0.33, ...],\n  \"source\": \"PRD\",\n  \"tags\": [\"design-doc\", \"battle\", \"overview\", \"what\"],\n  \"version\": 1\n}\n```\n\n- **id** – unique identifier or file reference\n- **text** – snippet used to generate the embedding\n- **qaContext** – short one-sentence summary used in tooltips or quick answers\n- **embedding** – numeric vector (typically ≤384 dimensions)\n- **source** – origin of the text (PRD, tooltip, etc.)\n- **tags** – optional categories for filtering results.

The array may also contain an intent tag like `what`.\n- **version** – embedding file version\n\nAgents can filter by these tag values when calling `findMatches`.","qaContext":"Embedding JSON Format Embeddings are stored in `client_embeddings.","embedding":[-0.1319,0.0993,-0.0613,-0.018,0.0736,0.0764,0.0071,0.0483,0.0959,-0.0619,-0.0236,0.0011,0.1124,0.0226,0.0078,0.0761,-0.0111,0.0199,-0.0418,-0.0237,0.0345,0.0665,0.0681,-0.0734,0.0923,0.099,-0.1016,0.1408,-0.0982,0.0345,0.0389,0.0707,0.0243,0.1147,0.0391,0.0504,-0.0746,-0.0052,-0.0679,-0.0071,-0.0393,0.1606,-0.1418,0.065,0.0384,-0.1244,-0.1444,-0.1235,-0.0522,0.1357,-0.1255,-0.0125,-0.001,0.0578,0.0802,-0.0543,-0.1282,0.0371,0.0228,0.0602,-0.0143,-0.0508,0.0539,-0.007,-0.0592,-0.1493,-0.0244,0.1325,0.016,-0.0929,-0.1009,0.0645,-0.1176,0.0303,-0.0593,0.1244,-0.0214,-0.0084,0.0497,-0.1957,-0.0193,-0.0736,-0.0327,0.0022,0.0681,0.0026,0.1342,-0.0071,0.0205,0.0242,-0.053,-0.1394,0.0786,0.0158,0.0781,0.0227,0.0679,-0.0057,0.0378,0.1344,0.0189,0.0483,0.074,-0.0019,0.0682,-0.0353,0.0565,0.0275,-0.0545,-0.1045,-0.0856,0.0963,-0.1383,-0.1495,0.0086,0.0043,0.0532,0.031,0.0071,0.0671,0.1148,-0.0467,-0.0675,-0.0187,0.013,-0.001,-0.0818,0,0.1013,-0.1724,-0.0039,0.0377,0.0225,-0.0754,-0.0093,0.0785,-0.1287,0.0136,-0.0677,0.1847,-0.0317,0.142,0.0087,0.0008,-0.0981,0.023,-0.0114,-0.0082,-0.0181,-0.0574,0.0072,0.0411,-0.0027,0.1159,0.0775,-0.0475,-0.0813,0.0282,-0.1174,-0.1226,-0.0149,-0.11,0.031,0.0337,-0.0252,-0.0464,-0.0299,-0.0498,-0.0142,-0.0561,-0.0882,-0.1341,-0.089,-0.0411,-0.0633,0.0611,0.0371,0.0134,-0.0201,0.055,0.0357,0.0097,0.0732,-0.0885,0.0616,0.0326,0.0071,0.0263,-0.0202,0.0659,0.0085,0.0595,0.0492,0.0313,-0.0186,0.0194,0.0228,0.0909,-0.0288,0.1131,0.029,-0.0113,0.0035,-0.1582,-0.0615,-0.0071,-0.0083,-0.0285,-0.0492,-0.0951,-0.0655,-0.0103,-0.1187,-0.1223,0.0587,-0.1684,-0.0524,-0.0397,0.0118,0.006,-0.1436,-0.0194,-0.0264,0,0.0565,-0.0216,-0.0404,0.0134,-0.0223,-0.0035,0.035,0.1171,-0.0575,-0.0724,-0.115,-0.0315,-0.012,-0.0912,0.0292,0.1213,-0.1762,-0.0019,-0.0588,0.0431,-0.0552,0.0915,0.0894,0.0909,0.1207,-0.0258,0.0836,-0.0192,-0.0648,-0.14,0.0471,-0.0814,-0.2157,-0.0774,-0.0299,-0.1,0.1846,-0.02,0.0213,0.0228,0.1217,0.0534,-0.1014,0.0788,0.0182,-0.0062,-0.1524,0.1037,0.126,-0.0504,0.0289,-0.0655,-0.0154,-0.0313,-0.0405,-0.0928,-0.0674,0.0072,-0.0807,0.0761,0.0231,-0.1338,-0.0458,0.0013,0.1122,-0.0635,-0.0417,0.0696,-0.1256,-0.0363,0.0223,-0.0305,0.047,-0.032,0.0294,0.0275,-0.0002,0.0007,0.0435,-0.0009,0.0967,-0.0079,0.0682,0.0736,0.0863,0.1353,-0.0181,0.1717,-0.0604,-0.0603,0.0282,0.0382,-0.002,0.2099,0.0548,0,-0.0982,-0.0139,-0.1322,-0.0014,-0.0278,0.0993,-0.0194,0.0271,0.0252,-0.0418,0.1993,0.0393,-0.1758,-0.0468,-0.0144,0.0008,-0.0399,0.0478,-0.006,0.0874,0.0248,0.0801,-0.0245,-0.0791,0.0303,-0.0104,-0.0303,0.1178,0.0645,-0.0535,0.1222,0.0292,0.0214,-0.0668,-0.0495,0.1065,0.1378,-0.036,-0.0378,0.1006,-0.011,-0.0065,-0.1595,-0.0822,0.0733,0.0268,-0.0661,-0.0237,0.0155,-0.0262,0.0079,-0.097,0.0164,0.0166,-0.0352,0.0545,0.0729,0.0465,0.1424,-0.0086,0.0942,-0.0131,0.104,0.1342],"source":"design/agentWorkflows/exampleVectorQueries.md [chunk 3]","tags":["prd","agent-workflow","what"],"version":1},
