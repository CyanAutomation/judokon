{"id":"prdVectorDatabaseRAG.md-chunk-2","text":"(RAG)\n ## TL;DR\n\nThis PRD defines the implementation of a lightweight vector database for semantic search across JU-DO-KON! assets such as PRDs, tooltips, and game rules. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** is an AI technique that combines semantic search with generative models, allowing agents to fetch relevant context from a database and use it to generate more accurate answers or suggestions. This system supports AI agent workflows (e.g. QA, card generation, bug reproduction, test case creation) by enabling agents to search project data semantically and provide context-aware responses. The feature integrates with AI chatbots, agent tools, and developer utilities for content search, hint generation, and automated reasoning.\n\n---\n","qaContext":"Why: The feature integrates with AI chatbots, agent tools, and developer utilities for content search, hint generation, and automated reasoning.

This results in agents producing invalid queries or misclassifying design intents — e.g., test cases missing kumi-kata interactions due to synonyms not being recognized.\n\nWithout a semantic memory layer, agents must either parse entire documents from scratch or rely on hardcoded rules — both of which are inefficient and error-prone.\n\nUltimately, these issues increase the risk of bugs reaching players, slow down the delivery of new cards, and make it harder to maintain design consistency — all of which degrade the play experience for our core audience (kids ages 8–12).\n\n---\n","qaContext":"Why: --- ## Problem Statement / Why It Matters As the JU-DO-KON!

The script at\n`scripts/generateEmbeddings.js` downloads the **quantized** `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model the first time it runs, so the command will fail without internet access. Cache the model locally or run it in an environment with a connection. Commit the updated `client_embeddings.json`—now pretty-printed for readability—so other agents work with the latest vectors. If you hit out-of-memory errors during generation, rerun the command with a higher heap limit (e.g. `node --max-old-space-size=8192 scripts/generateEmbeddings.js`). A GitHub Actions workflow could automate this\nregeneration whenever those folders change.\n\nThe generator parses JSON arrays and objects into individual snippets so each\nrecord receives its own embedding. For markdown sources, text is chunked from\none heading to the next heading of the same or higher level so each section is\nsemantically coherent.

Omit tooltips for elements where the function is fully self-explanatory.\n  - Stats on cards must provide tooltip descriptions using accessible markdown.\n  - Country flag icons require tooltips explaining nationality abbreviations.\n  - Weight indicators must include tooltip text clarifying weight classes.\n  - Navigation links in the battle screen should expose tooltip guidance.\n  - Help icons anywhere in the UI must render tooltip content from `tooltips.json`.\n- **Clarity**: Text should be immediately understandable, avoiding jargon. Game-specific terms must be explained using plain language. Aim for a reading level accessible to 10–12-year-olds.\n- **Concisiveness**: Tooltips should be succinct – ideally one sentence, or two short ones.

Settings such as sound, motion effects, display mode, navigation map, and feature toggles exist to empower users to tailor the game to their needs, accommodate diverse preferences, and ensure the game is welcoming for all. Without a clear, responsive settings menu, players may struggle to find comfort, leading to early churn and reduced engagement.\n\n> Kazuki, a player who’s prone to motion sickness, launches Ju-Do-Kon! for the first time. The opening animations make him dizzy, but he quickly finds the Settings Menu on the Judo Training Village Map. Within seconds, he toggles Motion Effects off — the UI instantly calms, and Kazuki can now enjoy battles without discomfort. By empowering players like Kazuki to control their experience, Ju-Do-Kon! becomes welcoming and inclusive.\n\n---\n","qaContext":"Why: --- ## Problem Statement Players need to easily adjust game settings to personalize their experience, improve accessibility, and reduce frustration.

A theoretical 10-year-old playtester noted:\n\n> \"The menu feels boring compared to the rest of the game — can it look more exciting? Maybe like a judo dojo or village?\"\n\nCurrently, the menu is purely functional but lacks the thematic cohesion that draws players deeper into the Ju-Do-Kon! world.

For example, a designer may notice that a card's padding looks off but has no way to inspect it visually without diving into browser dev tools. Without a quick in-app visual inspection tool, debugging layout issues becomes time-consuming and error-prone, leading to longer QA cycles and the risk of overlooking subtle bugs.

{"id":"prdHomePageNavigation.md-chunk-3","text":"and responsive across devices.\n\n---\n ## Introduction\n\nThis document describes the **Home Page Main Navigation Menu** for the JU-DO-KON! web-based judo-themed card battle game.\n\n> Imagine a new player, Ayumi, who’s just downloaded JU-DO-KON! after seeing a cool TikTok clip. She opens the game and instantly lands on a vibrant home screen where “Classic Battle” and “Random Judoka” tiles stand side by side, each pulsing slightly when she hovers. The judo-inspired icons draw her in, and she feels like she’s stepping onto the tatami mat (training mat). She sees “Meditation” and “Browse Judoka” neatly below, feeling in control and excited. Within seconds, she launches into her first match, confident she’s chosen the right mode. She tells her friends how easy it was to start. That’s the experience we’re building: immediate clarity, thematic immersion, and frictionless engagement.\n\nThe purpose of this menu is to allow players to access the core game modes quickly and intuitively. New players struggle to find and understand game modes quickly, leading to frustration, early churn, and reduced engagement. A clear, immersive, and fast-loading navigation menu is needed to orient players instantly (**menu load ≤2 s**), maintain the judo theme, and ensure accessibility across devices.\n\n> **Player Feedback Example**: \"I want to play the Team Battle, but I can't see the right button.","qaContext":"Why: The purpose of this menu is to allow players to access the core game modes quickly and intuitively.

By offering a fast-paced, low-stakes way for new players to learn stats and game flow (match start ≤5 s after selection), it boosts retention and confidence while maintaining quick matches. This PRD defines how the mode operates, from random draws to scoring and end conditions, ensuring a smooth, accessible, and engaging experience.\n\n> Sora starts a Classic Battle and draws her first card.

Without it, new players lack a quick, low-stakes mode to learn stats and grasp the core mechanics. This leads to higher early player drop-off, increased frustration, and fewer repeat sessions because players don’t build mastery or confidence. By providing a fast, engaging way to compare stats, Classic Battle helps new players onboard smoothly and encourages early retention.\n\n> **Player Feedback Example:**  \n> “I tried Ranked Mode first and felt lost — I didn’t know which stat to pick or what the cards meant.” – Playtester, Age 10\n\nThis feedback highlights why Classic Battle is needed now: new players currently face an overwhelming experience without a safe mode to experiment with card stats and turn flow.\n\n---\n","qaContext":"Why: --- ## Problem Statement Classic Battle is the main and simplest mode of the game.

This auto-select behavior is controlled by Random Stat Mode (`FF_AUTO_SELECT`), enabled by default. Timer must pause if the game tab is inactive or device goes to sleep, and resume on focus (see prdBattleScoreboard.md).\n- Stat selection timer halts immediately once the player picks a stat.\n- Detect timer drift by comparing engine state with real time; if drift exceeds 2s, display \"Waiting…\" and restart the countdown.\n- Opponent stat selection runs entirely on the client. After the player picks a stat (or the timer auto-chooses), the opponent's choice is revealed after a short artificial delay to mimic turn-taking.\n- During this delay, the Scoreboard displays \"Opponent is choosing...\" to reinforce turn flow.\n- The cooldown timer between rounds begins only after round results are shown in the Scoreboard and is displayed using one persistent snackbar that updates its text each second.","qaContext":"Why: player reaches a **user-selected win target of 5, 10, or 15 points** (default 10) or after **25 rounds** (draw).

Auto-selecting <stat>\" appears only if no stat was chosen before the timer expires.\n- After selection, the correct comparison is made, and the score updates based on round outcome.\n- After the player selects a stat, the Scoreboard shows \"Opponent is choosing...\" until the opponent's stat is revealed.\n- If the selected stats are equal, a tie message displays and the round ends.\n- After round results, `computeNextRoundCooldown` and `createNextRoundSnackbarRenderer` run a 3s countdown via snackbar (`Next round in: Xs`).

It’s clunky and slows everything down.” – QA Tester\n\nDevelopers and testers frequently need to verify the backend-bound data for each card to debug display issues, confirm game logic, or troubleshoot syncing problems. The current process — inspecting the DOM or logging to console — is slow, disruptive, and error-prone. These workarounds slow down development cycles and increase QA misses, especially as card content scales.\n\nThis problem is pressing because:\n\n- Card attributes and logic are rapidly changing during playtesting.\n- Iteration velocity is blocked by inefficient inspection tools.\n- QA teams must validate hundreds of cards across devices.\n\n---\n","qaContext":"Why: --- ## Problem Statement / Why It Matters > “Right now, I have to open the browser dev tools and hunt for the card data in the DOM.

{"id":"prdCardCarousel.md-chunk-3","text":"scan and select cards.\n\n---\n ## Problem Statement\n\nThe Judoka Card Carousel is a sub-component of the Browse Judoka feature. It provides an efficient, interactive way for players to browse and select judoka cards within the larger context of team building and roster management. Without a performant carousel, the Browse Judoka experience would be slow and frustrating, impacting overall gameplay and user satisfaction.\n\nAs part of the game, several screens require an intuitive and interactive way to present judoka cards. With more than 100 cards in the game (ultimate goal), it would be cumbersome and frustrating for players to browse through all cards manually without an efficient navigation system capable of loading cards quickly.\n\n> Emi wants to create her ultimate Japanese Judoka team. She opens the carousel and quickly swipes through beautifully animated cards, instantly comparing stats. She feels in control, excited, and invested in building the perfect team — that’s the experience this carousel delivers.\n\nFailure to provide an efficient browsing experience may impact core gameplay — players might struggle to find and build optimal teams, leading to frustration and potential churn.\n\n> A smooth and intuitive browsing experience fosters a sense of mastery and control, enhancing overall player satisfaction and engagement.\n\n---\n","qaContext":"Why: --- ## Problem Statement The Judoka Card Carousel is a sub-component of the Browse Judoka feature.

The command executes `scripts/validateData.js`, which validates using the Ajv library programmatically (no external CLI).\n\nRun the command for every pair of schema and data file (e.g. `gameModes`,\n`weightCategories`). The CLI reports any mismatches so they can be fixed before\nruntime. A new schema, `navigationItems.schema.json`, validates the structure of\n`navigationItems.json` which drives navigation order and visibility and is cached via the `navigationCache` helper. Another\nschema, `aesopsMeta.schema.json`, describes the quote metadata file used on the\nmeditation screen. A third schema, `statNames.schema.json`, defines the\nstructure of `statNames.json` which lists all available stats. This file is the\ncanonical source for stat labels—update it to change the names shown across the\nUI. Tests also verify that each ID in `aesopsMeta.json` exists in\n`aesopsFables.json`.

Each section (e.g. “Display Settings”, “General Settings”, “Game Modes”) should group related controls.  \n  _Example: The page currently has a “General Settings” fieldset for toggles like Sound, Navigation Map, and Motion._\n\n- **Consistent Form Structure**  \n  Use one `<form>` per section or a single form containing multiple `<fieldset>`s. Ensure consistency across all sections.\n\n- **Settings Item Container**  \n  Wrap each setting control in a `<div class=\"settings-item\">` for modularity and consistent spacing.\n\n- **Grid Layout for Controls**\n  Use the `.game-mode-toggle-container` class on fieldsets to enable responsive grid layouts:\n  - 3-column layout on desktop\n  - 1-column stacked layout on mobile\n  - The `Feature Flags` fieldset should include this class so flags display in a responsive grid.\n\n- **Responsive Design Preservation**  \n  New settings should stack vertically on mobile and arrange into columns on larger screens without breaking layout.\n\n- **Page Hierarchy**  \n  Maintain a logical top-down structure: main title `<h1>`, followed by fieldsets in an intuitive order (e.g. general → game-specific → advanced).","qaContext":"Why: style while maintaining high accessibility standards.

Feature flag\n  toggles must additionally provide `data-flag` for automation.\n  Example markup:\n\n  ```html\n  <label for=\"feature-battle-debug-panel\" class=\"switch\">\n    <input\n      type=\"checkbox\"\n      id=\"feature-battle-debug-panel\"\n      name=\"battleDebugPanel\"\n      data-tooltip-id=\"settings.battleDebugPanel\"\n      data-flag=\"battleDebugPanel\"\n      aria-label=\"Battle Debug Panel\"\n    />\n    <div class=\"slider round\"></div>\n    <span>Battle Debug Panel</span>\n  </label>\n  ```\n\n- **Select Boxes / Radio Buttons**\n  - Use standard `<select>` or `<input type=\"radio\">`, styled within the form using built-in styles (dark background, padding, rounded borders).\n\n- **Typography**\n  - Headings: Russo One\n  - Body text: use base font set in `base.css`\n\n- **Colors**\n  - Use CSS variables: `--color-primary`, `--button-bg`, etc.\n  - Do not hard-code color values.\n\n- Ensure all new elements work across Light, Dark, and High Contrast themes.","qaContext":"Why: class=\"settings-description\">Explains what the option does.

For example, the Browse Judoka PRD has a “Problem Statement” section explaining players’ frustration at not seeing all judoka at once.\n- **Goals / Success Metrics** – Quantitative (e.g. KPI targets) and qualitative goals that justify the feature. The Game Modes overview PRD lists KPI targets (e.g. “Increase returning player session length by 20%”) and player experience goals.\n- **User Stories** – Persona-driven scenarios that describe how different users will use the feature. Each PRD we checked includes user stories with format “As a \\[user], I want \\[action] so that \\[outcome]”.\n- **Functional Requirements (Prioritized)** – _A prioritized list/table of all required features or functions_.

These are often bullet points under an “Acceptance Criteria” heading.

Likewise, the Classic Battle PRD lists criteria such as “Cards are revealed in the correct sequence each round” and “Player can select a stat within 30 seconds; if not, the system auto-selects”. Each criterion should be measurable or verifiable (e.g. time limits, UI states, error handling).\n- **Non-Functional Requirements / Design Considerations** – Accessibility, performance, UX rules, etc. (e.g. “≥30 fps during scrolling”).

In JU-DO-KON PRDs, priorities are usually **P1** (must-have), **P2** (important), **P3** (nice-to-have).\n- **Be concise and descriptive:** The “Feature” column names the requirement, and “Description” explains it. For example, one entry is **“P1 – Random Card Draw: Draw one random card per player each round…”**. Another is **“P1 – Scrollable Card Interface: Allow players to scroll through the full judoka roster.”**.\n- **Cover all core behaviors:** Every major mode or feature should have its key functions listed. In the Game Modes PRD, a single table lists high-level features for all modes (e.g. Classic Battle, Team Battle Modes, etc.). In a mode-specific PRD (like Classic Battle), list all game mechanics (card draw, scoring, end conditions) as separate entries.\n- **Include additional details if needed:** After the main table, PRDs sometimes include further behavioral notes. E.g., the Classic Battle PRD adds bullet points on tie handling and start conditions. This is optional but can clarify nuanced rules.\n\n> _Example:_ The Classic Battle PRD’s prioritized requirements table lists P1 items like “Random Card Draw,” “Stat Selection Timer,” “Scoring,” and “Match End Condition” with clear descriptions.","qaContext":"Why: a gap.

{"id":"prdRulesForAgents.md-chunk-7","text":"new PRD. ## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- **One entry per requirement or scenario:** Each criterion states a condition that can be _tested_ or observed. Ideally, every P1/P2 feature has at least one acceptance criterion. For example, the Classic Battle PRD pairs its “Stat Selection Timer” requirement with “Player can select a stat within 30 seconds; if not, the system auto-selects a random stat”.\n- **Write testable statements:** Use clear language and measurable terms. Good criteria use specific numbers or UI actions (e.g. “loads within 1 second,” “score updates correctly,” “error message appears if…”). The Browse Judoka PRD requires, “The full list of up to 100 judoka cards loads and is visible within 1 second” and “Scrolling rapidly through the card carousel maintains ≥30 fps”.\n- **Cover success and failure cases:** Include criteria for normal operation _and_ error states. For instance, several PRDs check for JSON load failures (“display an error message if judoka.json fails to load”) or empty data cases. The Classic Battle PRD even specifies behavior on ties (“If the selected stats are equal, a tie message displays”).\n- **Use consistent format:** In JU-DO-KON docs, acceptance criteria are bullet points under a heading like “## Acceptance Criteria”. Each bullet starts with a hyphen and is written in present-tense imperative (e.g. “Cards are revealed…”, “Player can quit…”).","qaContext":"Why: new PRD.

{"id":"prdRulesForAgents.md-chunk-9","text":"data binding, accessibility) and are easily checkable. ## Additional Notes\n\n- **Clarity and Completeness:** A high-quality PRD uses precise wording (no vague terms) and ensures nothing important is omitted. For example, it’s good practice to reference related PRDs (as in “See PRD: Team Battle Rules”) and to link dependencies.\n- **Consistency:** Use similar section headings and formatting across PRDs. The existing docs use headings like `## Goals`, `## User Stories`, `## Functional Requirements`, `## Acceptance Criteria`, etc. Replicating these will help agents reliably parse and compare documents.\n- **Examples from the codebase:** The Classic Battle PRD (design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdClassicBattle.md) and Browse Judoka PRD (prdBrowseJudoka.md) are good models. Both include a prioritized requirements table followed by a bullet-list of acceptance criteria. AI agents can compare a new PRD against these examples to see if key elements are present.\n\nIn summary, **every PRD should spell out its features and how they will be validated**. Check that each functional requirement has an assigned priority and clear description (as in \\[33†L55-L64]), and that each has corresponding acceptance criteria (as in \\[36†L69-L76]). Missing any of these components indicates a gap in the document. By following these guidelines, AI agents can systematically evaluate PRDs for completeness and readiness for implementation.","qaContext":"Why: The existing docs use headings like `## Goals`, `## User Stories`, `## Functional Requirements`, `## Acceptance Criteria`, etc. How: Both include a prioritized requirements table followed by a...","embedding":[-0.136,0.044,-0.126,-0.046,0.003,0.057,0.023,0.104,-0.022,0.057,0.052,-0.005,0.155,0.015,0.084,-0.01,0.103,-0.036,-0.123,0.071,0.091,0.07,-0.021,-0.022,-0.112,0.049,0.007,-0.006,-0.085,0.004,0.048,0.083,0.069,0.003,0.115,0.071,0,-0.052,-0.088,0.042,-0.172,-0.021,-0.015,0.082,0.104,-0.042,-0.067,-0.057,-0.099,-0.001,-0.202,-0.027,0.047,-0.017,0.03,0.007,0.048,-0.09,-0.078,-0.13,-0.06,-0.068,-0.095,-0.017,0.009,-0.045,-0.011,0.021,0.059,-0.022,-0.104,0.114,0,0.048,-0.04,0.142,0.044,-0.002,0.013,-0.237,-0.105,0.108,0.023,0.053,0.038,-0.016,0.166,0.025,-0.015,0.097,0.126,-0.048,0.073,0.03,0.042,0.156,-0.024,-0.136,0.052,0.035,-0.041,0.017,-0.029,-0.129,-0.061,-0.055,0.06,-0.008,0.005,-0.117,-0.048,-0.018,-0.1,-0.061,0.085,-0.005,-0.077,-0.053,0.053,-0.078,-0.04,0.049,0.072,0.068,0.092,-0.013,-0.071,0,0.008,-0.062,-0.094,0.055,-0.07,-0.045,-0.044,-0.059,-0.02,0.05,-0.092,0.135,-0.136,-0.014,0.084,-0.024,-0.095,0.199,-0.123,0.05,0.057,-0.05,0.039,-0.034,0.159,0.147,0.032,-0.002,0.002,0.01,0.026,-0.081,-0.043,-0.053,-0.039,-0.004,-0.098,-0.077,-0.002,0.016,-0.064,-0.031,-0.024,0.057,0.014,-0.067,-0.011,0.021,0.12,0.011,-0.011,0.062,0.116,-0.047,-0.07,-0.068,0.011,0.008,0.045,0.088,-0.033,0.066,-0.03,0.078,0.008,0.117,-0.114,-0.016,0.172,-0.095,-0.101,-0.043,0.004,-0.065,0.065,-0.15,0.043,0.004,-0.001,-0.086,-0.18,0.119,-0.097,0.011,-0.092,-0.029,0.013,-0.07,-0.115,-0.005,0.031,-0.006,-0.156,0.092,0.104,0,0.027,-0.039,0.03,0.039,0.061,-0.03,-0.098,-0.087,0.094,-0.13,-0.021,-0.065,-0.048,-0.034,-0.106,0.021,-0.064,-0.087,-0.001,0.116,0.081,0.193,-0.114,0.034,0.041,0.036,-0.037,-0.129,0.035,-0.057,0.118,-0.036,-0.15,0.104,-0.06,-0.194,0.09,-0.054,0.047,0.183,0.159,0.043,-0.136,0.011,-0.064,0.075,0.029,-0.012,0.031,-0.043,0.014,-0.005,0.054,-0.009,-0.067,-0.039,-0.122,-0.107,-0.002,0.056,0.025,0.137,0.066,0.043,0.009,-0.121,0.011,-0.034,-0.024,0.004,-0.121,-0.12,-0.082,0.016,0.112,0.01,-0.041,-0.019,0.009,0.049,-0.019,0.066,-0.054,0.081,0.041,0.26,0.031,-0.039,0.032,0.083,-0.025,0.033,0.081,0.171,-0.099,0,-0.036,0.011,-0.03,0.014,-0.017,-0.046,-0.147,-0.008,-0.083,0.024,0.155,0.056,-0.223,-0.058,-0.028,-0.004,0.039,0.03,-0.113,0.007,0.047,-0.025,-0.118,0.02,0.047,0.013,-0.02,0.012,0.002,0.062,0.176,-0.004,0.018,-0.043,0.121,0.098,0.183,0.073,0.016,0.049,-0.004,0.073,-0.002,0.026,0.085,-0.005,-0.147,-0.174,-0.045,-0.111,-0.02,-0.069,-0.069,0.086,-0.095,0.225,0.13,-0.016,0.015,-0.012,0.167,0.048,0.059,0.102],"sparseVector":{"data":1,"binding":1,"accessibility":1,"easily":1,"checkable":1,"additional":1,"notes":1,"clarity":1,"completeness":2,"highquality":1,"prd":6,"uses":1,"precise":1,"wording":1,"vague":1,"terms":1,"ensures":1,"nothing":1,"important":1,"omitted":1,"example":1,"its":2,"good":2,"practice":1,"reference":1,"related":1,"prds":3,"see":2,"team":1,"battle":2,"rules":1,"link":1,"dependencies":1,"consistency":1,"use":2,"similar":1,"section":1,"headings":2,"formatting":1,"across":1,"existing":1,"docs":1,"like":1,"goals":1,"user":1,"stories":1,"functional":2,"requirements":2,"acceptance":3,"criteria":3,"etc":1,"replicating":1,"help":1,"agents":3,"reliably":1,"parse":1,"compare":2,"documents":1,"examples":2,"codebase":1,"classic":1,"designproductrequirementsdocumentsprdclassicbattlemd":1,"browse":1,"judoka":1,"prdbrowsejudokamd":1,"models":1,"include":1,"prioritized":1,"table":1,"followed":1,"bulletlist":1,"ai":2,"new":1,"key":1,"elements":1,"present":1,"summary":1,"every":1,"spell":1,"features":1,"validated":1,"check":1,"requirement":1,"assigned":1,"priority":1,"clear":1,"description":1,"33l55l64":1,"corresponding":1,"36l69l76":1,"missing":1,"components":1,"indicates":1,"gap":1,"document":1,"following":1,"guidelines":1,"systematically":1,"evaluate":1,"readiness":1,"implementation":1},"source":"design/codeStandards/prdRulesForAgents.md [chunk 9]","tags":["prd","design-guideline","why","utility"],"metadata":{"role":"utility","patterns":[],"relations":{"imports":[],"calls":[]}},"version":1},

Load mode definitions using `loadGameModes()` (reads `gameModes.json`).\n * 2. Fetch `navigationItems.json` for display order and visibility flags.\n *    - If either fetch fails, log an error and show a fallback message.\n * 3. Merge navigation items with mode data by matching the `id` field.\n * 4. Filter out items where `isHidden` is true and keep only main menu entries.\n * 5.

JSON arrays or objects (for example, tooltip sets or judoka data) are broken apart so every record gets its own vector. **The `embedding` field must be a flat numeric array (e.g. `[0.12, -0.04, ...]`) rather than an object with `dims` or `data`.**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"prdClassicBattle.md#overview\",\n  \"text\": \"Classic Battle is Ju-Do-Kon!'s introductory mode...\",\n  \"qaContext\": \"Classic Battle introduces the game's basic one-on-one mode.\",\n  \"embedding\": [0.12, -0.04, 0.33, ...],\n  \"source\": \"PRD\",\n  \"tags\": [\"design-doc\", \"battle\", \"overview\", \"what\"],\n  \"version\": 1\n}\n```\n\n- **id** – unique identifier or file reference\n- **text** – snippet used to generate the embedding\n- **qaContext** – short one-sentence summary used in tooltips or quick answers\n- **embedding** – numeric vector (typically ≤384 dimensions)\n- **source** – origin of the text (PRD, tooltip, etc.)\n- **tags** – optional categories for filtering results. Entries include a broad\n  label such as `prd` or `data` along with specific tags like `judoka-data` or\n  `design-doc`.

The script (`scripts/generateEmbeddings.js`) fetches the\n**quantized** `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model on first run, so it requires\ninternet access unless the model is cached. If the process runs out of memory,\nincrease Node's heap limit (for example `node --max-old-space-size=8192\nscripts/generateEmbeddings.js`).
