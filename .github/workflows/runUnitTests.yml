# Workflow Name: Run Unit Tests (Vitest)
# This workflow is triggered on specific events in the repository.

# Trigger Events:
# 1. When code is pushed to the 'main' branch.
# 2. When a pull request is created or updated.

# - The job runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.

# Steps in the 'test' job:
# 1. Check out the repository's code:
#    - Use the 'actions/checkout' action to clone the repository into the workflow environment.

# 2. Set up Node.js:
#    - Use the 'actions/setup-node' action to install Node.js version 18.

# 3. Install project dependencies:
#    - Run 'npm install' to install all dependencies defined in the 'package.json' file.

# 4. Run the test suite:
#    - Execute 'npm run test' to run the project's tests using Vitest.
