# ğŸŒ´ Feature Request: [Feature Name]

## 1. Problem Statement

_Describe the player pain point, real-world scenario, and why it matters now._

Example:

> Players currently find it difficult to locate judoka from a specific country. In playtests, younger players said, "I just want to find all the Japanese fighters without scrolling forever!" Without an easy filter, browsing engagement drops.

---

## 2. Player Actions and Game Flow

_List player triggers and describe what happens in response._

- **Trigger**: What the player does (click, tap, hover).
- **Outcome**: What they see or experience.
- **Cancel Option**: How the player can exit or cancel.
- **Timing**: Expected timing for animations or responses.

Example:

- **Trigger**: Player clicks the _Country Filter_ button.
- **Outcome**: A flag picker overlay slides in.
- **Cancel Option**: Tap outside or press "X" to close.
- **Timing**: Slide-in completes in â‰¤ 300ms.

---

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

_Define 3â€“5 specific, observable outcomes._

- [ ] **When** the player clicks _Country Filter_, **then** a grid of country flags slides in from the right within 300ms.
- [ ] **When** a flag is selected, **then** the Browse view immediately filters to show only judoka from that country.
- [ ] **When** no judoka match, **then** show "No Results" with an option to clear.
- [ ] **When** the clear filter button is clicked, **then** all judoka reappear.
- [ ] **When** the player taps outside or presses "X", **then** the overlay closes without changing the filter.

---

## 4. Player Settings (If Applicable)

_Describe any new settings, defaults, and behavior._

Example:

- No new settings introduced.
- Filter is in-session only; not saved between sessions.

---

## 5. Visuals or UX Reference

_Attach wireframes, mockups, or describe key visuals and animations._

Example:

- **Wireframe**: Browse Judoka screen with Country Filter button.
- **Flag Picker Overlay**: Grid of country flags, 5 columns.
- **Animation**: Smooth, 300ms slide-in from right, ease-out.
- **Visual Details**:
  - 48px minimum tap targets.
  - Clear Filter button at bottom.
