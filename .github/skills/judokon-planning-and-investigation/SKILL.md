# Skill Instructions

This skill is for thinking before coding.

## What this skill helps accomplish
- Avoid reinventing solutions
- Surface existing knowledge
- Ground decisions in prior work

## When to use this skill
- Investigating bugs
- Planning new features
- Exploring design options
- Answering “how does this work?” questions

## Mandatory behaviour
1. **Search the RAG vector database first**
2. **Summarise relevant findings**
3. **Cite existing code, PRDs, or docs**
4. **Identify unknowns explicitly**

## Investigation steps
1. Query RAG embeddings for related concepts
2. Review similar past implementations
3. Identify constraints and invariants
4. Propose next steps (not solutions yet)

## Expected output
- Investigation summary
- Referenced sources
- Clear recommendations or questions
