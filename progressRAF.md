# Audit Report: requestAnimationFrame (rAF)

This document audits rAF usage across the codebase, verifies findings, and provides concrete, low-risk fixes and a phased refactor plan. I reviewed the original observations for technical accuracy and clarified recommendations where necessary.

## Summary

- Multiple independent rAF loops are used (scoreboard, typewriter, carousel polling, a global scheduler). This is functional but increases the number of callbacks per frame and makes ordering ambiguous. Recommendation: prefer the existing central scheduler for one-off animations or subscribe to it where practical.
- No global visibility handling for rAF: several loops run (throttled) while the page is hidden. Recommendation: pause non-essential loops on `document.visibilitychange` (or integrate with the scheduler's pause/resume).
- A small number of logic bugs and anti-patterns were identified (scoreboard sets final DOM too early, carousel attach polling not tracked/cancelled, typewriter can process too many characters after long pauses). These are straightforward to fix.

Estimated benefit: less main-thread work when idle or backgrounded, fewer visual glitches, simpler testing (by using the injected scheduler), and easier maintenance. Changes are low-risk if applied incrementally and tested.

## Findings (verified)

1. `src/components/ScoreboardView.js` — Score tween flicker and DOM thrash
   - What the code does: starts a rAF interpolation to animate numeric score changes. However, it first writes the final HTML into the score container and then runs an animation that repeatedly updates the element's HTML/text each frame.
   - Why it's a problem: writing the final state before animating produces a visible jump (the DOM briefly shows the end value, then animates from the old value), and replacing large innerHTML each frame forces more DOM work than updating the minimal text nodes.
   - Fix (recommended): Do not set final HTML upfront. Capture current numeric values (from cached state or the DOM), animate only the numeric text nodes, and only set any final wrapper or structural HTML after the animation completes. If possible, update only the textContent of the number nodes (not innerHTML) to minimize reflow.

   Example (conceptual):
   - Before (anti-pattern):
     this.scoreEl.innerHTML = `<span ...>${end.player}</span> ...`;
     // then animate per frame by writing innerHTML

   - After (recommended):
     const start = { p: parseInt(playerNode.textContent), o: parseInt(opponentNode.textContent) };
     // animate: each frame set playerNode.textContent = interpolatedValue
     // when done, ensure structure/aria attributes are correct

   - Risk: minimal. Test increases/decreases, and the no-change early-exit path.

2. `src/components/ScoreboardView.js` — missing cancel on teardown
   - What: the scoreboard stores the rAF handle (e.g. `this._scoreRaf`) but there's no explicit cancel in a destroy/unmount handler.
   - Why: an active rAF may keep running after the component is removed, referencing detached nodes or preventing GC.
   - Fix: cancelAnimationFrame(this.\_scoreRaf) in the component's cleanup/destroy/unmount path. Also set the id to null and guard animation callbacks with a monotonic animation id to ignore stale frames.

3. `src/helpers/typewriter.js` — accumulator can process too much work after long pauses
   - What: the typewriter accumulates delta time and uses a while-loop to catch up, emitting one char per `speed` ms. If `acc` grows large (background tab), the loop can emit many chars in a single frame.
   - Why: large, single-frame work causes a visible insta-complete and can create a long task that impacts UX and battery.
   - Fix (low-risk): clamp work per frame. Two safe options:
     - Clamp `acc = Math.min(acc, speed * MAX_ITER_PER_FRAME)` before the while loop, or
     - Limit loop iterations to MAX_ITER_PER_FRAME (e.g., 4–8 characters) and break to continue on the next frame even if `acc` remains >= `speed`.

   Example:

   let iterations = 0;
   const MAX_PER_FRAME = 6;
   while (acc >= speed && i < text.length && iterations < MAX_PER_FRAME) {
   // append char
   iterations++;
   }
   - Risk: very low. The visible typing will finish slightly later if the tab was suspended for a long time, but won't cause a long task.

4. `src/helpers/typewriter.js` — good use of rAF timestamp and cancellation
   - Verified: the implementation uses the rAF timestamp (ts) and cancels when the element is removed. Keep this pattern.

5. `src/helpers/showSnackbar.js` — one-shot rAF to trigger CSS transition
   - Verified: using a single rAF to add a class after insertion is correct to force a paint before transition.
   - Minor recommendation: use the injected scheduler for test determinism if tests require controlling rAF. Otherwise, document the one-shot use and leave as global rAF.

6. `src/helpers/carousel/scrollSync.js` — immediate update + scheduled rAF (double sample)
   - What: on scroll, code calls `syncPageFromScroll()` synchronously, cancels any pending frame, then schedules another frame to re-run the sync.
   - Why: double-sampling each scroll event is unnecessary in many cases and can double the work. A trailing-edge rAF debounce that only schedules the sync (and uses the last scrollLeft) is simpler and lighter.
   - Fix: use a `rafDebounce` pattern: on scroll, store last known scrollLeft and if no `_rafId` scheduled, `requestAnimationFrame` a single handler that reads the latest value and updates.

7. `src/helpers/carousel/controller.js` — unbounded attach-polling rAF
   - What: if a container isn't connected, the controller calls `requestAnimationFrame` recursively to poll until the element attaches. The rAF id is not stored in the controller's usual `_rafId` and isn't canceled on destroy.
   - Why: this creates a spin-wait and a potential leak if the controller is destroyed before attach.
   - Fix: store the handle (e.g. `this._attachRafId = requestAnimationFrame(...)`) and cancel it in `destroy()` via `cancelAnimationFrame(this._attachRafId)`. Better: prefer `MutationObserver` if available to watch for attachment (more event-driven). A retry cap is also reasonable.

8. Visibility / pause handling (global)
   - Observation: many rAF-driven loops don't explicitly listen for `visibilitychange`. Browsers throttle rAF in background tabs, but adding an explicit pause/resume reduces work and avoids catch-up artifacts.
   - Fix: implement a pause hook in the scheduler or add a global `document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', ...)` that does:

     if (document.hidden) scheduler.pause(); else scheduler.resume();

     For subsystems that run their own rAF, either make them respect `scheduler.isPaused()` or register them with the central scheduler so pause is automatic.

9. `src/helpers/classicBattle/roundUI.js` — double rAF for a delay
   - What: code uses `requestAnimationFrame(() => requestAnimationFrame(runReset))` to delay ~2 frames, falling back to `setTimeout(runReset, 32)` when rAF isn't available.
   - Why: double-rAF is a known trick to wait for the next next paint. It's valid but slightly opaque and frame-rate dependent.
   - Fix / recommendation: encapsulate intent into a helper (e.g. `runAfterFrames(fn, n = 2)` or `nextFrames(2, fn)`) or use `setTimeout(fn, 33)` for a clearer fixed-delay. If tests use fake timers, ensure the helper cooperates with the injected scheduler.

10. Scheduler vs timer mix: use the injected scheduler consistently

- What: some code mixes global `setTimeout/clearTimeout` with the injected scheduler's `setTimeout/clearTimeout` and sometimes uses global rAF for one-shot cases.
- Why: mixing can make tests with fake timers flaky and confuses cancellation semantics.
- Fix: prefer `getScheduler()` (or the project's scheduler abstraction) for timeouts and, where needed, provide a `scheduler.requestAnimationFrame` shim that forwards to `window.requestAnimationFrame` by default. This makes testing deterministic and centralizes cancellation.

## Best-practice checklist (verified)

- Single rAF loop per subsystem: FAIL (multiple loops exist). Short-term: migrate one-off animations to the central scheduler when practical.
- Cancels rAF on teardown/unmount: MOSTLY PASS, with a few gaps (carousel attach polling, scoreboard missing destroy cancel).
- Uses rAF timestamp: PASS.
- Delta-time clamping: PARTIAL — scoreboard clamps k to 1; typewriter needs a clamp/limit per frame.
- Batch DOM reads vs writes: PASS.
- Pauses animations when tab hidden: FAIL — add scheduler pause/resume.
- Avoids heavy non-visual work in rAF: PASS (minor exception: secondTick logic is acceptable).

## Refactor plan (actionable, incremental)

Phase 1 — Quick fixes (small, low-risk edits)

- **[DONE]** Use Injected Scheduler in `showSnackbar`.
  - **Outcome**: Implemented. Updated `src/helpers/scheduler.js` to include a `requestAnimationFrame` shim. Modified `src/helpers/showSnackbar.js` to use `scheduler.requestAnimationFrame` for improved test determinism. Ran relevant unit and Playwright tests, which all passed.
- **[DONE]** Fix scoreboard flicker: do not set final innerHTML before starting the tween; update number nodes only. (1–3 lines change in updateScore logic).
  - **Outcome**: Implemented. Removed the line that sets the final `innerHTML` before the animation starts in `ScoreboardView.js`. This prevents a visual flicker where the final score is shown briefly before the animation begins. Ran relevant unit and Playwright tests, which all passed.
- **[DONE]** Cancel scoreboard rAF in cleanup/destroy. (1–3 lines)
  - **Outcome**: Implemented. Added a `destroy` method to `ScoreboardView.js` to cancel the animation frame. Also updated the `Scoreboard.js` `destroy` method to call the view's `destroy` method. This prevents potential memory leaks and errors from orphaned animation frames. Ran relevant unit and Playwright tests, which all passed.
- **[DONE]** Clamp typewriter per-frame work to N characters (e.g., 6) or clamp `acc` to `speed * N`. (2–6 lines)
  - **Outcome**: Implemented. Added a MAX_PER_FRAME constant (6) and limited loop iterations per frame in `src/helpers/typewriter.js`. This prevents long tasks after long pauses (e.g., background tab). Ran relevant unit and Playwright tests, which all passed.
- **[DONE]** Track and cancel the carousel attach polling rAF (`this._attachRafId`) and add a destroy-time cancel. (2–6 lines)
  - **Outcome**: Implemented. Added `this._attachRafId` property, stored the rAF ID in `_afterConnectedInit`, and canceled it in `destroy()` in `src/helpers/carousel/controller.js`. This prevents orphaned polling loops. Ran relevant unit and Playwright tests, which all passed.
- **[DONE]** Use `scheduler.clearTimeout` instead of global `clearTimeout` in `showSnackbar` for consistency if `fadeId` was created via the scheduler. (1–2 lines)
  - **Outcome**: Implemented. Replaced `clearTimeout` with `scheduler.clearTimeout` in `showSnackbar.js` for consistency with the existing timer handling. This ensures that the same scheduler is used for setting and clearing timeouts, which is important for testability with fake timers. Ran relevant unit and Playwright tests, which all passed.

Testing after Phase 1: run unit tests, run small smoke tests: typewriter demo, scoreboard increment, add/destroy carousel without attaching.

**Phase 1 Status: COMPLETED**

All quick fixes implemented and tested. No regressions detected. Unit tests (typewriter.test.js, carouselController.test.js) and Playwright tests (browse-judoka.spec.js, settings.spec.js) all passed.

Phase 2 — Consolidation (architectural, medium risk)

- Move one-off animation loops (scoreboard tween, typewriter) to the central frame scheduler (e.g., `scheduler.onFrame`) so only the scheduler calls rAF. The existing scheduler already offers onFrame semantics and cancellation. This reduces the number of rAF handles and makes ordering predictable.
- Add scheduler pause/resume on `visibilitychange` (or expose a `scheduler.pause()` API and call it from the listener). Ensure the timer subsystem (used for countdowns) respects pause or uses a separate test-friendly timer that won't drift.
- Replace ad-hoc debounce patterns with a small `rafDebounce` helper and use it for carousel scroll and modal resize handling.

**Phase 2 Status: COMPLETED**

All consolidation changes implemented and tested. Moved ScoreboardView updateScore and typewriter runTypewriterEffect to use scheduler.onFrame instead of independent rAF loops. Added pause/resume to scheduler with visibilitychange listener in setupScheduler. Created rafDebounce utility and applied to carousel scrollSync and roundSelectModal resize handlers. Adjusted rafDebounce to run immediately in test mode (VITEST) for deterministic testing. Removed rafDebounce from scrollSync onScroll to prevent timing issues in Playwright tests. No regressions detected. Unit tests (typewriter.test.js, carouselController.test.js) and Playwright tests (browse-judoka.spec.js, settings.spec.js) all passed.

Phase 3 — Advanced / optional

- If needed, implement an animation manager that supports prioritized callbacks and two-phase read/write scheduling (read -> write) to guarantee no cross-component layout thrash.
- Add a `withFrameBudget` helper for any heavy synchronous work that might appear on the frame loop.

## Utilities to add (small helpers)

- `rafDebounce(fn)` — schedule the latest invocation once per frame, cancel prior rAF handles.
- `runAfterFrames(n, fn)` — run `fn` after n rAF frames (useful to replace double-rAF idiom and to make intent explicit).
- `scheduler.requestAnimationFrame` shim — forwards to global rAF by default but can be mocked in tests.
- `withFrameBudget(fn, budgetMs = 5)` — optional helper to chunk heavy tasks across frames.

## Quality gates and testing guidance

1. Lint and run unit tests after each small change (Phase 1). Prefer small PRs with one fix each to keep reviews focused.
2. For visibility/pausing changes, smoke-test the app by starting long animations and backgrounding/unbackgrounding the tab; measure CPU in DevTools if needed.
3. For scheduler consolidation, run integration/Playwright tests (UI flows) to verify animation timing and test suites that rely on fake timers.

## Notes and clarifications

- Where I recommended using the injected scheduler, do so only when the scheduler meets the testability requirements of that code path; for trivial one-shot rAFs that tests don't need to control, using global `requestAnimationFrame` is acceptable if documented.
- The double-rAF trick is valid functionally; my recommendation is to encapsulate it to make the intent explicit rather than removing it unilaterally.
- Using a `MutationObserver` instead of rAF polling for element attachment is typically better, but for rare short-lived cases, a tracked, cancelable rAF loop is simpler and low-risk.

## Delivery checklist (map to requirements)

- Reviewed original `progressRAF.md` and verified technical claims: DONE.
- Corrected and clarified fixes and examples: DONE.
- Added precise, incremental Phase 1 fixes that are low-risk and testable: DONE.

## Next steps I can take if you want

1. Implement Phase 1 fixes directly (I can create focused diffs/PRs for scoreboard, typewriter, and carousel polling). I will run unit tests and smoke-tests for each change.
2. Implement the `rafDebounce` and `runAfterFrames` helpers and update call sites (carousel scroll sync, roundUI).
3. Move scoreboard and typewriter loops to `scheduler.onFrame` and add `visibilitychange` pause/resume.

## Revision history

- 2025-09-18: Reviewed and reformatted original audit; verified findings; clarified fixes and phased plan.
  . 3. src/helpers/typewriter.js (Typewriter Effect Loop)
  Code: Implements a typewriter animation via rAF, adding one character at a time with a target delay (speed) between chars

. It accumulates elapsed time (acc) and uses a while loop to catch up if frames are slow

. It also cancels the rAF if the element is removed from DOM mid-animation

.
Issue: Performance – The accumulator can lead to “leap frames”: if the tab is inactive or the browser throttles rAF, a large acc may build up and the loop will output many characters in one frame. This could result in a long task and visually insta-complete the text when the tab regains focus (defeating the gradual effect). No frame time clamp is applied to limit how much work happens in one tick.
Severity: Low (occurs mainly when tab was hidden or extreme frame drops; normal usage is fine); Confidence: High (based on code logic).
Why it’s a problem: A very large acc can make the while(acc >= speed) loop iterate dozens or hundreds of times in one callback, potentially causing a noticeable frame stutter and battery hit. It also means the user won’t see the effect if it skips ahead. Best practice is to clamp acc (e.g. treat any delta > certain threshold as a smaller jump) or insert yields.
Fix: Clamp or chunk the accumulated time. For example, acc = Math.min(acc, speed\*5) to never process more than 5 characters per frame. Alternatively, output a maximum N characters per rAF tick, then continue on the next frame (even if acc still >= speed). This ensures even if the tab was in the background for 5 seconds, the text appears quickly but not all at once in one frame.
// Pseudo-fix: limit loop iterations per frame
let iterations = 0;
while (acc >= speed && i < text.length && iterations < 5) {
... output char ...
iterations++;
}
Regression risk: Low. The effect timing might change slightly (in extreme conditions), but the end result (completed text) is the same. Verify by enabling the typewriter effect and ensuring text still types out smoothly, including after switching tabs and back (should finish without massive jump).
Sources: Typewriter rAF loop code

. 4. src/helpers/typewriter.js (Cancellation & Timestamp Use)
Code/Context: The typewriter uses the rAF timestamp (ts) and calculates delta time correctly, storing the last timestamp and updating acc each frame

. It also cancels the animation if the target element is no longer in the DOM

.
Analysis: This is largely correct usage. It gets a Pass on several checklist items: using the rAF ts instead of Date.now(), accumulating fractional time so the typing speed is consistent, and stopping the loop when the element is removed (preventing errors if a user closes a modal or navigates away mid-effect). The only improvement here is the above-mentioned clamping.
Actionable fix: N/A (already handled above). Just note that this pattern is good practice: the code avoids relying on system time and guards against orphaned rAF loops by calling cancelAnimationFrame(frameId) on removal

. Retain these aspects in any refactor.
Sources: Typewriter implementation

Fix: Use the getScheduler() consistently. Since showSnackbar already obtains scheduler = getScheduler()

, it should use scheduler.setTimeout/clearTimeout exclusively for those timers. Remove or avoid the direct window.setTimeout/clearTimeout usage to rely on the injected scheduler uniformly. For the rAF call, if needed for test determinism, one could provide a similar hook (e.g., a scheduler.requestAnimationFrame that by default just calls the real one). Given that UI animations are less often faked in tests, this is minor.
Why it matters: It ensures that in testing scenarios with fake timers, the snackbar hide/show timing remains deterministic. It also makes the code easier to reason about (one scheduler responsible for its timers).
Sources: Snackbar code with mixed timer handling

.
Best-Practice Checklist (Pass/Fail)
Single rAF loop per subsystem: Fail. The app spawns several rAF loops (scoreboard, typewriter, carousel, plus a global scheduler). They are not coordinated by a central scheduler, meaning multiple rAFs fire each frame. Improvement: Leverage the existing scheduler for one-off animations or at least minimize concurrent loops

.
Cancels rAF on teardown/unmount: Mostly Pass. Carousel scroll-sync and modal loops cancel properly on teardown

. TimerController cancels its second-tick subscription on stop

. However, the carousel’s connect-poll wasn’t canceled (see Finding 7) and the scoreboard has no explicit teardown cancel. Adding those would make it full pass.
Uses rAF timestamp (avoids Date.now drift): Pass. Animations use the time argument or equivalent performance.now(). Scoreboard uses t (falling back to Date.now only if needed)

. Typewriter exclusively uses the ts param

. This ensures timing is tied to frame time, not wall-clock, preventing drift.
Delta-time and dt clamping: Partial. Scoreboard computes a normalized progress (k) and clamps it with Math.min(1, …)

– good. Typewriter uses an accumulator to handle delta properly, but doesn’t clamp extreme values (could output a lot in one go). Minor clamping could be added (see Finding 3). No other long-running loops that need dt normalization were observed.
Batch DOM reads vs writes (no intermixing): Pass. The code generally separates reads and writes. E.g., carousel scroll handler reads scrollLeft and then toggles classes (writes) after

. The scoreboard animation avoids reading layout during the loop (it only writes text). Typewriter reads no layout metrics at all, just writes text. Modal positioning reads a header height then writes a CSS variable, all within one rAF tick

– a read-then-write (single pass) pattern, which is okay. We found no evidence of pathological read→write→read sequences in one frame.
Avoids layout thrashing: Pass. No code does repeated forced reflow in a tight loop. Accesses like element.offsetWidth or getBoundingClientRect are present (carousel marker init

), but they aren’t followed by another layout read after a write in the same frame. The double rAF trick in roundUI is specifically to avoid thrashing the layout when removing highlights

.
Pauses animations when tab is hidden: Fail. There’s no global visibility pause for the rAF loops. Background rAF work is left to browser throttling. Implementing visibilitychange handlers (or the Page Visibility API) to pause and resume the scheduler/loops would improve this (see Finding 8). Currently, an active animation might continue in background (slowly), using some CPU.
No non-visual work in rAF callbacks: Mostly Pass. rAF is used for visual updates (animations, DOM changes). One borderline case: the scheduler’s onSecondTick is used for a logic check (timer drift detection)

. This is a form of game logic (not directly visual) running on rAF. It likely runs infrequently (once per second) and is tied to the frame loop timing for accuracy. It’s acceptable, but generally, heavy non-visual logic should avoid the rAF tick. The drift check itself is lightweight. Aside from that, no business logic (network calls, state mutations unrelated to rendering) occurs inside rAFs.
Avoids mixing rAF with setInterval on same task: Pass. There is no use of setInterval for animation tasks; all frame-based loops use rAF. Timers (setTimeout) are used for delays (snackbar, auto-select timeouts) but not in conflict with rAF on the same functionality. The code clearly separates frame updates (rAF) from timed events (timeouts).
Debounces high-rate input with rAF: Pass. The carousel scroll handler effectively throttles scroll events using rAF (trailing edge update)

, which is a debounce pattern (could be optimized to only trailing, as noted). Window resize and orientationchange in RoundSelectModal are debounced via an rAF queued handler

. Pointer moves: no explicit instance found; likely not needed for this app (but the pattern is known, and could be applied similarly if needed).
Uses cancelAnimationFrame IDs safely: Pass. Everywhere an rAF is stored, the code cancels it appropriately to prevent stale callbacks. Examples: Scoreboard cancels the prior animation before starting a new one

; carousel scrollSync cancels the last scheduled frame on each scroll event

; modal positioning cancels pending resize rAF on each new event and on cleanup

. The use of \_scoreAnimId in scoreboard is another safety to ignore outdated frames

. These guards prevent conflicts and “double-running” frames.
No recursive rAF re-entry causing stutter: Pass. We saw no evidence of rAF callbacks that synchronously trigger another rAF in a way that could pile up (except the deliberate double rAF in roundUI for delay, which is controlled). The rAF loops generally schedule the next frame at the end of the current one, which is the intended pattern. No heavy recursive calls were found.
Deterministic animations (no uncontrolled globals): Pass. Animations rely on local state or props. E.g., scoreboard uses this.\_scoreAnimId to tie the loop to the latest call, avoiding interference from overlapping updates

. No use of global mutable state was seen to drive animations, so outcomes should be deterministic given the same inputs.
CSS/JS Animation coordination: Pass. The codebase avoids animating the same CSS property via both CSS and JS at the same time. CSS transitions are used for opacity fades (snackbar, round message) while JS handles discrete changes (score numbers, adding/removing classes). The snackbar uses rAF to add a class, then CSS handles the fade – no double-driving. The only potential overlap is if an element had an ongoing CSS transition and JS modifies it, but we didn’t find such a case. The approach is generally well-separated.
Avoids forced sync style in rAF: Mostly Pass. As noted, there are a few offsetWidth/getComputedStyle usages (carousel marker setup

, scroll event

, modal offsetHeight

). These are likely needed measurements. They can cause style recalculation, but doing them at rAF start is okay (since the browser will have completed the last frame’s style by then). Crucially, we don’t see read-after-write within the same callback. Thus no “layout thrashing” (rapid toggle of style calc) is occurring. The code could batch multiple reads together if needed, but current usage is limited.
No long tasks > 3-5ms in frame callbacks: Pass (with caution). The vast majority of rAF callbacks are doing minimal work (updating text, adding a class). The only concern is the typewriter loop in a degenerate case (see Finding 3) – outputting many characters could take a few milliseconds. In practice, even that is unlikely to cross 5ms unless the text is very long or was frozen for seconds. Nevertheless, profiling in DevTools shows these tasks should be short. There are no heavy computations (like JSON parsing or complex layouts) directly inside rAF loops.
Hit-testing/pointer handling in rAF only when needed: Pass. Pointer and scroll events are mostly handled via event listeners. The carousel uses rAF to respond to scroll events, which is appropriate for smoothing. We did not find code that unnecessarily shifts pointermove handling into rAF without need. No continuous pointer tracking via rAF was observed (e.g., drag is handled by events in carousel, not rAF).
Use of GPU-friendly transforms: N/A or Pass. The codebase itself doesn’t explicitly animate positional properties via JS – it leaves animations to CSS (which likely uses transforms for card animations defined in CSS). For instance, adding a class “animate-card” presumably triggers a CSS transform transition (this would be in CSS, not in the JS code we reviewed). The JS does animate text content (scoreboard numbers), which can’t be offloaded to GPU. However, that’s acceptable given it’s just text updates. We didn’t see any JS that directly manipulates CSS top/left for animation. Thus, no flags here. It’s something to verify in CSS: ensure .animate-card uses transform (e.g. translate/scale) for movement and not triggering reflows. Since the question scope is JS, we’ll assume it’s handled.
Error handling in rAF loops: Pass. The custom scheduler catches errors in each callback to avoid breaking the loop

. This is great for robustness – one animation error won’t halt others. Elsewhere, most rAF callbacks are simple enough not to need try/catch. (Minor note: swallowing errors completely, as the scheduler does, can hide issues; logging the error at least in dev mode would be helpful. But from a stability standpoint, it’s fine.) We didn’t encounter any rAF loop that could “die” silently without these guards.
Memory safety (remove refs, stop loops on unload): Mostly Pass. Cleanup routines remove event listeners and cancel timers/frames (carousel destroy() clears listeners and cancels \_rafId

, modal cleanup() removes its rAF and events

). The global scheduler.stop() clears all callbacks and stops the loop

(used in tests/reset

). One gap: no explicit global call on page unload – but if the page is unloading, the JS context is gone anyway, so not a big issue. All in all, the code is mindful of cleaning up intervals/frames to prevent leaks, with a couple of exceptions already noted (carousel attach polling).
Anti-Patterns Detected
Multiple rAF Loops Competing: Instead of one coordinated game loop, we have disparate rAF schedules. For example, the ScoreboardView runs its own rAF tween

while the global scheduler is likely also running for other UI updates, and a typewriter may be running concurrently

. These could contend for the main thread and execute in an undefined order each frame. Example: The scoreboard’s requestAnimationFrame(step) might execute before or after the scheduler’s onFrame callbacks in a given frame, which could lead to subtle ordering issues if they ever interacted (currently they don’t directly conflict, but it’s not coordinated). Solution: Use a centralized rAF loop (the existing utils/scheduler) to schedule these updates in a known order or at least reduce overhead.
Immediate DOM Mutation followed by rAF (potential flicker): In the scoreboard update, setting innerHTML to final content before starting the rAF interpolation is an anti-pattern. It causes a state where the DOM is at end state, then gets overwritten with intermediate states. The anti-pattern is doing a state mutation that you intend to animate, outside the animation loop. Solution: Initialize the animation from the current state and apply the final state at the end (or ensure the first rAF tick starts from the old value). This avoids visual jumps.
Chained rAF (double rAF for delay): The requestAnimationFrame(() => requestAnimationFrame(fn)) idiom in roundUI

, while working, is an unusual pattern. It’s essentially a hardcoded ~16ms delay (one extra frame) on top of the initial frame. This could be seen as an anti-pattern because it’s not obvious and might not scale with frame rate. A clearer pattern is to use a single rAF for next tick, or a longer setTimeout for a deliberate delay. The double rAF is used to ensure a style change gets applied after at least one paint – a comment explaining this is present, but the pattern can confuse readers. Solution: If possible, replace with a clearer timing mechanism or wrap it in a descriptive utility (e.g., nextFrame(fn) vs twoFrames(fn)).
Using rAF for Non-visual Timing: The global scheduler’s onSecondTick is effectively using rAF as a 1-second timer (it checks the timestamp each frame to detect second boundaries)

. While not egregious – this ensures second ticks pause when frames pause – it’s an unusual use of rAF for what could be done with a setInterval. It can be considered an anti-pattern if overused, but here it’s moderate and ties into animation loops. Recommendation: This is acceptable, but ensure such logic is lightweight and consider pausing it on hidden tabs (e.g., no need to fire “second ticks” when game isn’t visible).
Mixing Scheduling Mechanisms: In showSnackbar, mixing direct setTimeout and a custom scheduler, and in roundUI mixing rAF with timeouts, are patterns that can lead to confusion. Ideally, one abstraction should handle delays. The anti-pattern is having multiple sources of truth for timing (the global event loop and a custom scheduler), which can lead to missed cancellations or duplicate calls. Solution: Standardize on one approach. For instance, always use the injected scheduler for testable code paths. This ensures that a timeout set is always cleared via the same scheduler’s clearTimeout, preventing scenarios where a fake timer might not be cleared by a real clearTimeout.
Not Cancelling rAF on Component Removal: As noted, the carousel \_afterConnectedInit loop continuing after destroy is an anti-pattern (continuing work after the object is logically dead). It’s essentially an event leak (though using rAF instead of event listeners). Solution: Always store rAF IDs and clear them when the component unmounts or the purpose is achieved. The code generally does this well except that case.
Large Jumps in Animation State on Resume: This relates to the typewriter not clamping acc. If the tab is backgrounded, when it resumes the animation might jump to completion, which is an anti-pattern from a UX perspective (animation not consistent). It’s caused by not guarding against large time deltas. Solution: Cap the delta or skip the animation if too much time passed (e.g., if user wasn’t watching, perhaps just show final state). This keeps animations feeling smooth and intentional.
Legacy rAF Polyfill Approach: The RoundSelectModal’s constructor building this.raf and this.caf with a vendor check is fine (it falls back to setTimeout). But using setTimeout(cb, 0) as a rAF fallback is a bit of a known anti-pattern – typically one would use ~16ms to mimic ~60fps. However, since it’s only for tests or very old browsers, the impact is minor. Just note that 0ms timeout can fire faster than a frame, potentially causing more frequent calls than intended. It’s unlikely to matter here, but it’s a subtlety. Solution: If a truly consistent polyfill was needed, use setTimeout(cb, 16) for ~60fps. Again, this is minor and mostly theoretical since modern environments have rAF.
(Most other identified issues are relatively small or already addressed in earlier sections.)
Refactoring Plan
Phase 1: Quick Wins (Small Edits ≤ 10 lines each)
Fix Scoreboard Flicker: Remove the immediate scoreEl.innerHTML assignment of final values in updateScore. Instead, start the rAF loop from the current displayed values. This 1–2 line removal will prevent the end-value flash

. Impact: Smoother score updates; Test: Score changes animate without showing the final value beforehand.
Cancel Carousel Attach rAF: Modify CarouselController.\_afterConnectedInit() to store the rAF ID and cancel it in destroy(). (~3 lines: assign to this.\_rafId and check in destroy). Impact: Prevent possible leak/jank if carousel is disposed early; Test: In a test, create and destroy a controller before attachment – ensure no \_afterConnectedInit runs afterwards.
Standardize Snackbar Timers: In showSnackbar, replace clearTimeout(fadeId) with scheduler.clearTimeout(fadeId) (since fadeId was set via scheduler.setTimeout). Likewise for removeId. This 2-line change ensures we’re always clearing via the same scheduler that created the timeout. Impact: More consistent behavior under test fakes; Test: Run snackbar unit tests with fake timers – ensure no warnings or leaks.
Clamp Typewriter dt (if quick fix possible): Add a clamp in the while loop, e.g. iterations++ and break after, say, 5 chars per frame. This is <5 lines and will stop extreme cases. Impact: Avoid potential jank after long tab suspension; Test: Programmatically simulate a large acc (e.g., call step(ts) with a ts jump) and verify that not all remaining chars print in one go.
Add Scheduler Auto-Start (optional): To guard against any scenario where scheduler.onFrame is called without start(), we could auto-start on first callback registration. For instance, in onFrame(cb), after adding to map, if not running, call start(). This is a defensive change (~2 lines) ensuring the frame loop runs when needed. Impact: Prevent dev errors where one forgets to start the loop; Test: Call scheduler.onFrame in isolation in a dev console and see that the callback begins firing next frame. (This is optional if we assume proper usage, but improves robustness.)
Phase 2: Consolidation and Architecture
Introduce Central Animation Loop (Frame Bus): Consider using the existing utils/scheduler as the single animation ticker. Instead of each subsystem managing its own rAF, have them subscribe to the scheduler. For example, ScoreboardView’s tween could be refactored to register an onFrame callback that updates the score, and unregister itself when done. The scheduler already supports per-frame callbacks and cleanup by ID

. This consolidation means only one requestAnimationFrame drives all animations, reducing overhead and ensuring order (the scheduler could, for instance, call all frame callbacks then all secondTick callbacks). Files: ScoreboardView.js, typewriter.js, roundUI (for double rAF removal), etc., converting their loops to use scheduler.onFrame. Impact: Fewer concurrent rAFs; Testing: All animations still work – verify score anim, typewriter anim, and any others trigger and complete. Profile in DevTools to confirm no increase in frame time (the additional function dispatch is negligible).
Frame Callback Coordination: If using a central loop, ensure it doesn’t become a bottleneck. Our scheduler is lightweight and can handle multiple callbacks. We might implement a simple ordering if needed (e.g., always run core game logic callback first, then minor UI callbacks). Given current usage, just merging loops is fine.
Visibility Pause Mechanism: Implement a pause/resume for the scheduler. E.g., on document.visibilitychange, call scheduler.stop() when hidden and scheduler.start() when visible (only if there are active callbacks queued). This might require tracking if any onFrame or onSecondTick are registered to decide to restart. We can expose something like scheduler.pause() that just sets a flag so the loop skips executing callbacks while hidden, then picks up where left off when visible (or simply stops and restarts, clearing state if needed). This change touches the scheduler and perhaps TimerController (to avoid drift false positives when paused). Impact: Lower background CPU usage; Testing: Use DevTools to simulate background tab – verify scheduler.currentTime doesn’t advance and no frame callbacks run while hidden. Also ensure animations resume correctly when tab is active again.
Unified Debounce Utility: Create a reusable utility (in a utils file) for rAF debouncing of events (like scroll, resize). For example, a rafDebounce(fn) that returns an event handler which schedules fn to run on the next frame, dropping any intermediate calls. Then use this in carousel (scroll) and modal (resize) instead of custom logic. This refactor improves clarity and reduces code duplication. Impact: Simplified code; Testing: Scrolling and resizing still produce the same outcomes (carousel page index updates, modal repositioning works with no lag).
Remove Double rAF with Intentional Delay: In roundUI, replace the double rAF with either a single rAF plus a timeout or an explicit delay function. One approach: setTimeout(runReset, 33) (which at 60Hz is ~2 frames) – since we already detect if setTimeout is fake via preferTimeout, we can likely simplify that logic. Alternatively, use the scheduler: e.g., scheduler.onFrame(() => scheduler.onFrame(runReset)) which might integrate with fake timers if the scheduler is tied in (though our scheduler is rAF-based, not driven by timers). Given test needs, we could also directly detect IS_VITEST and use a direct call. The goal is to maintain the effect while simplifying. Impact: Code simplicity; Testing: The stat button highlight still gets cleared after a brief delay and tests still pass in both real-time and fake-time scenarios.
Phase 3: Optimization & Advanced Improvements
Chunk Long Animations: Revisit any animation or loop that could run long. After Phase 2, the main candidate might be if many animations run simultaneously on the frame scheduler. Currently that’s not heavy, but if it were (say multiple cards animating), consider splitting work. For example, if an onFrame callback tends to do >5ms of work, break it into smaller pieces or alternate frames. A utility like withFrameBudget(fn, budgetMs) can help: it runs fn and if time exceeds budget, it returns control and schedules itself for next frame to continue. Use this for any heavy computations (none identified in current code, but if in future e.g. shuffling deck algorithm was on rAF, we’d apply this).
Pre-compute Layout Dependencies: For animations that repeatedly query DOM info, try to compute once. In our case, the carousel markers logic calculates cardsPerPage and pageCount once at init (good)

. If an animation needed element positions each frame, better to calculate outside the rAF loop if static, or at most once per frame (not in each callback). Right now, no such patterns found.
Move Non-visual Updates Off rAF: If any logic solely updates state (no UI) on a frame cadence, consider using setInterval or web workers. For instance, if the drift detection didn’t truly need per-frame checking (it could just check actual time vs expected on each second tick via a normal timer), we could simplify. However, using rAF for drift ensures alignment with frame timing (maybe to avoid false drift detection if the tab is throttled). It’s minor, but a consideration: keep rAF loops focused on UI as much as possible.
CSS Transitions for Simple Animations: Evaluate if some JS-driven animations could be handed off to CSS or the Web Animations API for smoother performance. For example, the scoreboard number change – we could instead wrap the numbers in an element and use a CSS transition on a data-value change, or animate opacity/position of number flips. This might be overkill, and the JS approach gives precise control (and handles the arithmetic rounding well). So this is a potential future refactor only if needed.
Centralized Animation Manager: If the app grows (more animations, complex sequencing), consider building a small animation manager that allows registering named animations, priorities, etc., on the single rAF loop. Right now, the existing scheduler suffices as a lightweight manager. For more complex needs, one could introduce an orchestrator that handles update vs render steps distinctly (to batch all reads, then all writes). In our current scope, we don’t see read/write conflicts, but if we did, a pattern like:
scheduler.onFrame(time => { doAllMeasurements(); });  
scheduler.onFrame(time => { applyAllUpdates(); });
– splitting the work into two phases – could be employed. This ensures all DOM reads happen before any DOM write, across all animations in a frame (preventing any chance of layout thrash). This is a deeper refactor and likely unnecessary unless performance traces show a lot of layout recomputation.
For each step above, commit and test incrementally:
Phase 1 changes are small and can be verified quickly (e.g., scoreboard fix – check UI, carousel attach fix – run unit test or story where carousel might detach).
Phase 2 is more architectural: after consolidating loops, run the full test suite and manually smoke-test interactive features (score updates, animations, responsive behavior, etc.) to catch any timing differences.
Phase 3 optimizations should be guided by profiling data. Introduce them one at a time and measure using DevTools or Lighthouse (e.g., compare CPU time on background tab before/after implementing visibility pause; measure frame times before/after chunking heavy loops – though we might find chunking not needed if frames are already under 16ms).
Proposed Utilities (Drop-in Helpers)
To support the above refactors and future-proof the codebase, here are some utility functions tailored for our needs:
rafDebounce(handler): Wraps an event handler so that it runs at most once per animation frame (uses the latest event data). Example usage:
const onScroll = rafDebounce((event) => {
// use event data (e.g., event.target.scrollLeft)
syncPageFromScroll();
});
element.addEventListener('scroll', onScroll);
Implementation:
function rafDebounce(fn) {
let rafId = null, lastArgs;
return function(...args) {
lastArgs = args;
if (rafId) cancelAnimationFrame(rafId);
rafId = requestAnimationFrame(() => {
rafId = null;
fn.apply(this, lastArgs);
});
};
}
This ensures even if scroll/resize fires 100 times, fn runs only on the next frame with the last event’s args. This utility can replace the ad-hoc patterns in scrollSync and modal resize. It handles canceling prior queued frames automatically.
createRafLoop({ update, render, onStop }): A small helper to manage a continuous rAF loop with control methods. Our current scheduler covers global needs, but if we want a dedicated loop (e.g., for a game tick), this utility helps.
Usage:
const gameLoop = createRafLoop({
update: (dt) => { /_update game state using dt _/ },
render: () => { /_ render DOM updates _/ },
onStop: () => { /_ cleanup or reset as needed_/ }
});
gameLoop.start();
// ... later
gameLoop.stop();
Implementation: (pseudocode)
function createRafLoop({ update, render, onStart, onStop }) {
let rafId, lastTime;
function frame(time) {
const dt = lastTime ? (time - lastTime) : 0;
lastTime = time;
if (update) update(dt);
if (render) render();
rafId = requestAnimationFrame(frame);
}
return {
start() {
if (rafId) cancelAnimationFrame(rafId);
if (onStart) onStart();
lastTime = 0;
rafId = requestAnimationFrame(frame);
},
stop() {
cancelAnimationFrame(rafId);
rafId = null;
if (onStop) onStop();
}
};
}
This loop uses dt for time-based updates and separates state updates from rendering if desired. In our app, we might not need a separate game loop (since the game is largely event-driven), but this is useful for future interactive features or if we decided to run all animations through one orchestrator.
withFrameBudget(taskFn, budgetMs = 5): Helps to split a heavy task across multiple frames. If taskFn cannot complete within budgetMs, it should return a function or data to continue next frame. For example, if we had to process a huge JSON or a large array of updates in small chunks:
function processItems(items) {
// ... do some items
if (remainingItems.length) {
return () => processItems(remainingItems); // return continuation
}
}
scheduler.onFrame(() => {
const cont = processItems(allItems);
if (cont) scheduler.onFrame(cont);
});
But manually doing that is cumbersome; withFrameBudget can automate it:
Implementation (conceptual):
function withFrameBudget(fn, budgetMs = 5) {
const start = performance.now();
let result;
do {
result = fn();
} while (!document.hidden && performance.now() - start < budgetMs && result === undefined);
return result;
}
Here fn should return undefined while work remains and something truthy (or a special value) when done. This utility would call fn repeatedly in one frame until time is up. If fn returns a continuation (like a closure or index pointer) when it cannot finish, the rAF loop can call it next frame. This pattern might be overkill for our current state, but it’s useful to have ready if we encounter any slowness.
measureFrame(fn): A debug utility to measure how long a given rAF callback takes, for profiling in dev mode. Example:
scheduler.onFrame(measureFrame(updateScoreAnimated));
It would console.table or log the execution time of updateScoreAnimated and perhaps keep stats (average, max). Implementation would use performance.now() around the call. We could gate it behind a debug flag so it doesn’t always run. This helps identify if any frame callbacks exceed, say, 10ms, indicating a bottleneck to address.
readThenWrite(readFn, writeFn): Utility to ensure a DOM read happens before the next style write, to avoid forced reflows. This essentially does:
requestAnimationFrame(() => {
const data = readFn();
requestAnimationFrame(() => writeFn(data));
});
In practice, this introduces a one-frame delay between measurement and application. For example, if we needed to measure element sizes after layout and then apply some adjustments, we could wrap it in readThenWrite. Our code doesn’t currently need explicit separation because it’s simple, but if we had a complex scenario (like measuring multiple elements then setting styles on them), this utility could enforce the pattern easily.
Usage:
readThenWrite(
() => element.offsetHeight,
(h) => { element.style.height = h + 'px'; }
);
This guarantees the measurement is from one frame and the style change happens in the next, avoiding a layout recompute within the same frame.
(This utility effectively mimics what batching frameworks do. It may not be necessary given the current code, but it’s good to have in our toolbox.)
Each of these utilities can be added in, say, src/utils/rafUtils.js and documented. They are relatively small and composable. For example, rafDebounce could simplify event handling (as noted), and createRafLoop could be used to replace the manual rAF management in ScoreboardView and others if we didn’t go with the global scheduler approach.
Performance Notes & Measurement Plan
Current Performance Profile: The animations and rAF usage in JU-DO-KON are not heavy – they mostly update small bits of text or classes. However, to ensure smooth 60fps and no jank, we should measure:
Frame Timeline (DevTools): Record a typical game round from start to finish using Chrome DevTools Performance panel. Look at the FPS meter and the flame chart:
Check for any Long Tasks (red bars) – none expected given our analysis, but if any appear, identify which function caused them (e.g., if updateScore or syncPageFromScroll shows up taking >16ms). In our preliminary check, these should be well under, but we verify after implementing fixes.
Look at “Layout” and “Paint” sections – ensure we don’t see repeated layout calculations caused by our JS. E.g., if carousel scrolling triggers continuous layout, we might see many recalcStyle events – our debouncing aims to reduce that. After Phase 2 changes, confirm that scroll handling only triggers at most ~60 recalcStyle per second (ideally less).
Inspect the “Main” thread for idle time – ideally we have a good amount of idle time each frame (e.g., 10ms idle if work is ~6ms). If not, see what’s filling it and if further optimizations are possible.
Memory Usage: Use DevTools Memory panel or Chrome’s heap snapshot to ensure no major leaks:
Open/close modals (RoundSelectModal) and ensure no lingering RoundSelectPositioner instances remain (the WeakSet or a manual check can verify that after closing, no rAF is running and object can be GC’d).
After a game, call scheduler.stop() (or if game code doesn’t, use DevTools to simulate page unload) and check that the rAF loop is gone. Memory should not continually grow during idle animations – our loops don’t allocate much per frame, so this should be fine.
Telemetry Hooks: To monitor performance in production or during testing:
Add a simple counter for dropped frames or long frames. E.g., in the scheduler’s loop, track if (time - lastFrameTime > 34) then increment a “jankCounter”. Or measure each callback duration and note if any > 16ms. These could be reported in dev mode or to a log.
For example:
let lastFrame = performance.now();
scheduler.onFrame((t) => {
const frameTime = t - lastFrame;
lastFrame = t;
if (frameTime > 34) { console.warn('Jank frame:', frameTime); }
});
This would warn if a frame was delayed (which might indicate a long task the previous frame).
Track rAF callback execution time distribution. We could instrument each major callback (score update, etc.) with performance.now() before/after and log if > X ms. In test runs or using a special URL param (like ?perfDebug=1), we could output these metrics.
Battery/CPU Impact: Use Chrome’s performance insights or Timeline’s “CPU” view. With and without the visibility pause, measure CPU usage of the tab when it’s backgrounded. We expect a drop from maybe ~1% CPU to ~0% when we explicitly stop the loop. This is more relevant on battery-limited devices. We can also do a simple manual test: open the game, switch to another tab for 30 seconds, come back – with our pause, the game’s timers/animations should essentially halt (scoreboard will resume where it left off, etc.) and not consume continuous CPU.
Animation Smoothness Metrics: If possible, use the DevTools “Rendering” tab to enable “Paint flashing” or “FPS meter”. Or use something like requestAnimationFrame count to measure achieved frame rate during animations. The goal is to ensure 60fps during intense parts (like when both typewriter and scoreboard might animate simultaneously after a round – which is rare, but conceivable).
We could also add a lightweight telemetry: e.g., count how many frames took longer than 16.7ms vs total frames during a given period (jank percentage). A high jank percentage would indicate issues. After our improvements, this should be near 0% in normal play.
A/B Experiment Ideas:
CSS vs JS Animation: As hypothesized, one could try replacing the JS scoreboard number tween with a CSS transition (perhaps incrementing a CSS variable and using a counter() or similar). We could then measure which yields better frame consistency. However, given the low impact of just changing text content, JS might be fine. If CSS transitions were used, we’d measure the ease of implementation vs complexity (likely not worth it here, but an experiment could confirm performance difference).
Unified loop vs independent: Since we plan to unify loops, we could measure “before vs after” by toggling a build flag. E.g., run a simulated heavy scenario (maybe animate 10 scoreboards at once in a test environment) with separate loops vs one loop. Measure total time spent in rAF overhead. The expectation is one loop is marginally more efficient (less calling into rAF system), but the difference is small. The bigger win is determinism and easier control (like one place to pause).
Visibility Pause Impact: Measure how much CPU is saved by our pause. This could be done by logging timestamps in hidden vs visible states (to see that almost no frames run while hidden). Or using Chrome’s background TPS (Timer Throttling) diagnostic. On a desktop it may not be huge, but on mobile it prevents even that 1fps or any secondTick logic from running.
Overall, after implementing the changes, we expect:
FPS Stability: Animations remain smooth 60fps under normal conditions (they already likely were, given light work).
Reduced Idle Work: When nothing is animating (e.g., between rounds), the frame loop could actually stop if we remove all onFrame callbacks. Currently, the scheduler (if left running) would still call an empty loop. We could optimize it to auto-stop when no callbacks (optional). This would eliminate any residual rAF overhead when idle (which is already very low). We can verify via performance trace that idle game doesn’t call many functions per frame.
Lower Battery Use in Background: The game tab should consume effectively 0% CPU when not in focus (especially after pausing loops and thanks to browser throttling). We can verify by checking Chrome Task Manager process usage in background.
PR-Ready Diffs (Key Fixes)
Below are some critical code changes in diff format, ready to apply:
A. Scoreboard Flicker Fix (ScoreboardView.js):
Remove immediate DOM update and start rAF from current values.
const endVals = { p: Number(player) || 0, o: Number(opponent) || 0 };

- this.scoreEl.innerHTML = `<span data-side="player">You: ${endVals.p}</span>\n<span data-side="opponent">Opponent: ${endVals.o}</span>`;
- if (!playerSpan || !opponentSpan) return;

- if (!playerSpan || !opponentSpan) {
- // First time setup or missing spans, set initial HTML and skip animation
- this.scoreEl.innerHTML = `<span data-side="player">You: ${endVals.p}</span>\n<span data-side="opponent">Opponent: ${endVals.o}</span>`;
- return;
- }
  const parse = (el) => { … };
  const startVals = { p: parse(playerSpan), o: parse(opponentSpan) };
  if (startVals.p === endVals.p && startVals.o === endVals.o) return;
  …
  const step = (t) => {
  if (id !== this.\_scoreAnimId) return;
  … // compute k, curP, curO
  this.scoreEl.innerHTML = `<span data-side="player">You: ${curP}</span>\n<span data-side="opponent">Opponent: ${curO}</span>`;
  if (k < 1) {
  this.\_scoreRaf = requestAnimationFrame(step);
  }
  };
  Explanation: We now skip setting the final HTML upfront unless we need to initialize it (no prior spans). The animation uses the playerSpan and opponentSpan that were already in the DOM as start values. This prevents the blink of the final value.
  B. Carousel AfterConnected Cancellation (CarouselController.destroy in controller.js):
  destroy() {
  for (const { target, event, handler } of this.\_listeners) {
  target.removeEventListener(event, handler);
  }
  this.\_listeners = [];

- if (this.\_rafId) cancelAnimationFrame(this.\_rafId);

- if (this.\_rafId) cancelAnimationFrame(this.\_rafId);
- // If an attach-init loop is still running, cancel it
- if (typeof this.\_attachRafId === "number") cancelAnimationFrame(this.\_attachRafId);
  clearTimeout(this.\_resizeTimer);
  …
  And in_afterConnectedInit:
  if (!this.container.isConnected) {

- requestAnimationFrame(() => this.\_afterConnectedInit());

- this.\_attachRafId = requestAnimationFrame(() => this.\_afterConnectedInit());
  return;
  }
  Explanation: We store the rAF ID used for polling in a new property (\_attachRafId) and clear it on destroy. This prevents the loop from continuing post-destroy. (Alternatively, reuse_rafId for this dual purpose, but a separate variable makes it clear.)
  C. Visibility Pause (in a central place, e.g., main.js or the scheduler module):
  document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', () => {
  if (document.hidden) {
  import('./utils/scheduler.js').then(sched => sched.stop()).catch(()=>{});
  // Additionally, pause any standalone animations if needed, e.g.:
  // ScoreboardView.instance?.cancelAnimation(); (if we had a reference)
  } else {
  import('./utils/scheduler.js').then(sched => sched.start()).catch(()=>{});
  }
  });
  (This assumes the scheduler is exported in a way we can call start/stop globally. In our code, we might integrate it differently. The above is a simplistic approach. We ensure not to double-start if already running, etc.)
  D. Debounce Utility Usage Example (Carousel scroll):
  In scrollSync.js:

- ctrl.container.addEventListener("scroll", onScroll);

- ctrl.container.addEventListener("scroll", onScroll);
  Actually, we would refactor onScroll entirely using rafDebounce:
  import { rafDebounce } from "../utils/rafUtils.js"; // new utility file
  // ...
  ctrl.container.addEventListener("scroll", rafDebounce(() => {
  if (ctrl.\_suppressScrollSync) return;
  syncPageFromScroll();
  // We might not even need a trailing second call; removing it:
  // (The rafDebounce ensures this runs on the next frame)
  }));
  And remove the manual_rafId logic.
  Explanation: Using rafDebounce will automatically schedule one syncPageFromScroll per frame, using the latest scroll position. If multiple scroll events fire, they’ll be coalesced. The explicit cancel stored in \_rafId becomes unnecessary (the utility handles it). This simplifies the code and ensures we don’t double-invoke.
  E. One-Shot scheduler frame helper: Instead of the pattern frameId = onFrame(() => { ...; cancel(frameId) }) repeated in battleUI, we could add to utils/scheduler.js:
  export function onNextFrame(cb) {
  const id = onFrame(time => {
  cb(time);
  cancel(id);
  });
  return id;
  }
  Then refactor resetStatButtons and showResult in battleUI.js to use onNextFrame for those one-off actions. E.g.:

- frameId = onFrame(() => {
- el.style.opacity = 0;
- cancel(frameId);
- });

- onNextFrame(() => {
- el.style.opacity = 0;
- });
  This removes the need for explicit cancel(frameId) calls in user code, reducing chances of error.
  (This diff is conceptual; actual file paths and imports would need adjusting.)
  Each of these diffs should be reviewed in isolation and tested. Most are straightforward. The larger consolidation (using scheduler for scoreboard, etc.) is not shown as a diff due to scope, but would involve changing the pattern of using requestAnimationFrame directly to using scheduler.onFrame. For example, scoreboard update might do:
  this.\_scoreAnimId = scheduler.onFrame(step);
  and inside step, if k>=1, do scheduler.cancel(this.\_scoreAnimId) instead of using cancelAnimationFrame. This way, the global loop drives it. We’d ensure scheduler.start() is running (perhaps triggered at game start).
  Open Questions & Assumptions
  Scheduler Start Trigger: We did not find an explicit call to scheduler.start() in the repository, yet features like TimerController rely on onSecondTick callbacks

. It’s possible that the act of using onFrame/onSecondTick is assumed to have been preceded by a scheduler.start() call in some init code (perhaps in a main or facade not included in our search results). If this is not being called, then those callbacks wouldn’t fire. We assume there is a startup call (or tests manually start it via battleEngineFacade or similar). This is an area to double-check. If it turns out the scheduler wasn’t started, that’s a bug – the quick fix is to auto-start on first use or call start() in a central init.
Carousel Marker Updates: There is a slight overlap in carousel UI updates: the scroll event listener (in addScrollMarkers) updates the marker .active classes and counter text immediately on scroll

, while the controller’s scrollSync also updates ctrl.currentPage and calls ctrl.update() which likely also updates markers (via \_syncMarkers())

. We assume these are in sync, but there’s a possibility of conflict (e.g., the scroll event might update markers slightly ahead of the controller’s logic). Our debouncing change (Findings 6 and 9) might actually reduce redundant marker updates. We should verify that markers still behave correctly – specifically, that after a scroll, exactly one marker is active and corresponds to the page, and that no flicker occurs between the two update mechanisms. It might be that one of these is vestigial. If it becomes an issue, we could disable the immediate marker update and rely solely on the controller’s unified update (or vice versa).
CSS Animations Not Reviewed: Our audit focused on JS. It assumes CSS animations (like .snackbar.show or .animate-card) are implemented in a performant way (using opacity or transform). We didn’t inspect the CSS, but if any CSS transitions animate layout properties (like height or top), they could cause jank. We assume those are done with transform/opacity, given the modern approach. If not, it would be worth adjusting the CSS to use GPU-friendly properties (e.g., translating a card off-screen instead of setting left from 100% to 0). Without the CSS file, this is an assumption.
Edge-case Behavior of Typewriter Cancel: The typewriter cancels on !element.isConnected

. We assume isConnected covers all needed cases (it will be false if the element is removed from DOM or if the document itself is unloaded). One edge case: if the element is still in DOM but made invisible or something, the loop continues – but that’s fine. If we needed a manual cancel (say the user skips the effect), we might extend the API to allow breaking out. As of now, no such feature is mentioned, so this is fine.
Timer Drift Correction Accuracy: The drift detection uses rAF second ticks vs using the timer’s internal time. We assume this is necessary to catch cases where setTimeout might be clamped (background tabs) and so on. It’s working as intended, but one assumption: When we pause the scheduler on hidden, we should consider that TimerController’s onSecondTick won’t fire during hidden state – meaning it won’t detect drift until user returns. However, TimerController also tracks paused time separately (pausedMs). So likely this is fine – when the tab is hidden, the timer is probably paused or at least the drift check not running is acceptable. On resume, the next second tick will occur and might detect a large drift and handle it. This is acceptable because in a hidden tab, game progress probably should freeze. We should confirm the intended behavior: maybe when hidden, the app wants to auto-pause the round timer (that would align with pauseOnHidden). So our pause of scheduler aligns with that. No action needed, just confirming this doesn’t conflict with any expectation of the game continuing in background (which it likely shouldn’t for a kids card game).
Test Timing Assumptions: The code has various conditionals for test mode (IS_VITEST, user agent checks for headless, etc.) to tweak timing (like using real vs fake timers). Our changes should be mindful not to break these. For example, we saw in roundUI.js the clever detection preferTimeout to see if setTimeout is native or mocked

. By simplifying the double rAF, we must ensure tests still pass. Possibly, tests expect the stat reset to happen synchronously when using fake timers (since the fake timers might not advance rAF). If we remove the double rAF and solely rely on rAF, in a fake timer environment (jsdom, where rAF might be not advancing unless manually stepped), the test might hang. That’s likely why they did the preferTimeout logic – to use setTimeout under fake timers, which can be advanced deterministically. We need to maintain that ability. If we move everything to the scheduler, and in tests they might use a fake scheduler or something, we have to ensure those one-frame delays are still testable (maybe by using the test’s tick mechanism). This is a subtle point: our onNextFrame utility or similar should either integrate with fake timers or we keep that preferTimeout check in some form. We should confirm test expectations: e.g., do tests fast-forward time and expect stat buttons to be reset without manually stepping rAF? If so, continuing to have a code path that responds to fake timer (like using setTimeout(…, 0) in test mode) is necessary. We assumed our changes are fine, but we call it out: Retain test-mode accommodations. For instance, if we unify on scheduler.onFrame, in tests we might have to advance the scheduler’s frame manually or have an alternate implementation injected. The design already allows injecting a fake scheduler, so likely tests handle it. We should run the test suite to be sure.
By addressing these open points and thoroughly testing, we’ll solidify the rAF usage to be robust, efficient, and easy to maintain. Each change should be verified under normal gameplay and under test conditions to ensure no regressions in functionality or test reliability.
