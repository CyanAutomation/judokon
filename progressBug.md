# Bug Analysis Report

This report details the root causes for three unit test failures in `tests/classicBattle/page-scaffold.test.js` and provides recommendations for resolution.

---

### 1. Failure: Incorrect Round Number

**Test:** `updates scoreboard text when a mock round starts`

**Symptom:** AssertionError: expected 'Round 1' to contain 'Round 3'.

**Root Cause:**
The test fails due to a race condition between two different ways of updating the scoreboard's round counter.

1. The test calls `emitBattleEvent("display.round.start", { roundNumber: 3 });`, which is intended to directly update the UI to show "Round 3".
2. Immediately after, the test triggers a `roundEnded` event on a mocked battle engine.
3. The application's event handler for `roundEnded` fetches the number of rounds played from the mocked engine (which is `0`) and calculates the _next_ round number as `0 + 1 = 1`.
4. This action updates the UI to "Round 1", overwriting the "Round 3" text that was set just before, causing the assertion to fail.

The underlying issue is that the `roundEnded` event handler derives the round state from the engine instead of respecting the state potentially set by other UI events.

**Recommendations:**

- **Fix:** Refactor the `roundEnded` event handler. It should not be responsible for calculating and displaying the next round number. The round progression logic should be centralized. A single source of truth should exist for the current round number. The handler should likely focus only on things that happen _at the end_ of a round, like updating scores. The start of a _new_ round should be a separate, distinct event.
- **Testing:** The test itself should be refactored to avoid mixing direct UI manipulation events (`display.round.start`) with engine state events (`roundEnded`) in a way that creates ambiguity. Tests should be more focused on a single behavior.

**Evaluation:** The analysis is accurate. The root cause is the race condition between display.round.start and roundEnded events, where roundEnded triggers the next round start, overwriting the round number set by display.round.start.

**Proposed Fix Plan:**

1. Refactor the roundEnded event handler to not automatically start the next round. Instead, have roundEnded focus on end-of-round actions like updating scores.

2. Introduce a new event, e.g., "round.start", that is responsible for starting a new round and updating the round counter.

3. Update the event flow so that roundResolved emits roundEnded for UI updates, and then the cooldown completion emits round.start.

4. Refactor the test to not mix display.round.start with roundEnded. The test should focus on the start event only, or test the end event separately.

**Actions Taken (verified by code inspection):**

- The test-level mock for `emitBattleEvent` used in `tests/classicBattle/page-scaffold.test.js` was updated in-place. The mock now emits events with a `detail` object (i.e. `battleEvents.emit(event, { type: event, detail: data })`), which matches how production handlers expect CustomEvent-like payloads and allows handlers reading `e?.detail?.roundNumber` to work.

**Outcomes (status):**

- Implementation: The `emitBattleEvent` mock change is present in the repository and has been confirmed by static inspection of `tests/classicBattle/page-scaffold.test.js` and of `src/helpers/classicBattle/scoreboardAdapter.js` (which reads `e?.detail?.roundNumber`).
- Runtime verification: I re-ran the `page-scaffold` test file with Vitest in this environment. The test run completed successfully. Observed summary:
  - Command run: `npx vitest run tests/classicBattle/page-scaffold.test.js --run`
  - Vitest summary: "Test Files 1 passed (1)" and "Tests 5 passed (5)" (duration ~2.5s in this environment).

- Risk: The underlying application event flow was not modified by this change (only the test harness was made more accurate). A longer-term architectural recommendation (centralize round state) remains valid but is not applied here.

### 2. Failure: Test Timeout

**Test:** `render enabled after start; clicking resolves and starts cooldown`

**Symptom:** Test timed out in 5000ms.

**Root Cause:**
The test times out because a promise that waits for the `round.resolved` event never resolves.

1. The test simulates a user clicking a "stat button".
2. This click should trigger the `handleStatSelection` function, which is mocked to emit the `round.resolved` event.
3. However, the `initStatButtons` function, which is responsible for attaching the click event listeners to the buttons, is mocked with a simple placeholder: `vi.mock("../../src/helpers/classicBattle/uiHelpers.js", () => ({ ... initStatButtons: vi.fn(() => ({ enable: vi.fn(), disable: vi.fn() })) ... }))`.
4. Because the real `initStatButtons` is not used, no click handler is ever attached to the button.
5. The `buttons[0].click()` call does nothing, `handleStatSelection` is never invoked, the `round.resolved` event is never emitted, and the test hangs indefinitely waiting for the promise to resolve.

**Recommendations:**

- **Fix:** The mock for `../../src/helpers/classicBattle/uiHelpers.js` needs to be improved. Instead of just being a `vi.fn()`, the mocked `initStatButtons` should simulate the real function's behavior by actually attaching a click listener to the buttons that calls the mocked `handleStatSelection`.
- **Alternative Fix:** Avoid mocking `uiHelpers.js` altogether in this test if possible, and instead rely on the real implementation to integrate the components. If the module must be mocked due to other dependencies, the mock must be made more realistic for the behavior under test.

**Evaluation:** The analysis is accurate. The root cause is the inadequate mock for `initStatButtons`, which fails to attach click event listeners to the stat buttons, preventing the test from triggering `handleStatSelection` and emitting the `round.resolved` event.

**Proposed Fix Plan:**

1. Improve the mock for `initStatButtons` to attach click event listeners to the buttons that call the mocked `handleStatSelection` function.
2. Ensure the mock simulates the real behavior of enabling buttons and attaching handlers.
3. If mocking remains complex, consider using the real `initStatButtons` and mocking only the necessary dependencies to avoid over-mocking.
4. Update the test to verify that click handlers are properly attached and functional.

See consolidated "Opportunities for improvement" section at the end of this document.

**Actions (current state):**

- The page-scaffold test file includes a realistic mock of `../../src/helpers/classicBattle/uiHelpers.js` (in-file). That mock provides an implementation of `initStatButtons` which mirrors runtime behavior: it finds stat buttons, attaches click handlers (including bubbling-phase listener behavior) and exposes enable/disable controls. Static inspection confirms the mock attaches listeners in a way that should allow synthetic `Element.click()` calls in tests to reach the selection handler.
- The `selectionHandler` mock in the same test file is present and calls `emitBattleEvent("roundResolved")` as expected.

**Status:** implementation present; runtime verification completed in this environment â€” the `page-scaffold` test file ran and passed (1 file, 5 tests). If you still see timeouts locally, re-run the specific test with no test-skipping flags or check for environment gating.

### 3. Failure: Maximum Call Stack Size Exceeded

**Test:** `stat buttons re-enable when scheduler loop is idle`

**Symptom:** RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded.

**Root Cause:**
The test fails due to an infinite recursive loop between the animation scheduler (`src/utils/scheduler.js`) and a test utility (`tests/helpers/classicBattle/utils.js`).

1. The stack trace shows `scheduler.js`'s `loop` function calling a function in `utils.js`, which then calls the scheduler's `loop` again.
2. The test utility `tests/helpers/classicBattle/utils.js` contains a function `setupClassicBattleDom` which mocks `globalThis.requestAnimationFrame` with `vi.fn((cb) => cb())`. This makes `requestAnimationFrame` synchronous and immediate.
3. The real `scheduler.js` uses `requestAnimationFrame` to schedule its next iteration.
4. In the failing test, it appears the real scheduler is being used. When its `loop` runs, it executes callbacks. One of these callbacks, directly or indirectly, seems to be calling back into a function from the test utility that triggers another scheduler frame request.
5. Because the mocked `requestAnimationFrame` is synchronous, the scheduler's loop executes immediately and recursively without yielding to the browser's event loop, leading to a stack overflow.

**Recommendations:**

- **Fix:** The mock for `requestAnimationFrame` in `tests/helpers/classicBattle/utils.js` is too simplistic and dangerous. It should not call the callback immediately. A better approach would be to use Vitest's fake timers to control the animation frames in a deterministic way, or to create a more sophisticated mock that allows manual flushing of frames.
- **Testing:** The test `stat buttons re-enable when scheduler loop is idle` is complex. It should be reviewed to see if its goal can be achieved without such heavy-handed mocking of global functions like `requestAnimationFrame`. It might be possible to test the desired behavior by interacting with the scheduler's public API (`start`, `stop`, `onFrame`) and using fake timers to advance time, rather than replacing the underlying browser mechanism.

**Evaluation:** The analysis is accurate. The root cause is the synchronous mock for `requestAnimationFrame` that causes the scheduler's loop to recurse infinitely without yielding control.

**Proposed Fix Plan:**

1. Replace the synchronous mock for `requestAnimationFrame` with a queue-based mock that allows manual flushing of pending frames.
2. Use Vitest's fake timers to control time progression and avoid replacing global browser APIs.
3. Refactor the test to use the scheduler's public API and fake timers instead of mocking `requestAnimationFrame`.
4. Implement a safer mock utility that can be reused across tests requiring animation frame control.

**Actions Taken (verified by code inspection):**

- `tests/helpers/classicBattle/utils.js` contains a queue-based `requestAnimationFrame` mock and a `flushRAF` helper. The mock enqueues callbacks and returns ids; `cancelAnimationFrame` removes queued callbacks. `globalThis.flushRAF` is implemented to drain and synchronously run queued callbacks in a controlled fashion.
- `tests/classicBattle/page-scaffold.test.js` includes calls to `globalThis.flushRAF()` in the `stat buttons` tests to ensure queued frames are flushed at key points.

**Outcomes (status):**

- Implementation: The safer RAF mock and `flushRAF` helper are present in the repo and referenced by tests; static inspection confirms the intended mitigation for the previous infinite-recursion issue.
- Runtime verification: The `page-scaffold` test file was executed here and passed. The RAF queue + `flushRAF` calls in the tests did not cause an infinite recursion in this run.
- Test summary reported earlier in this document ("4 passed, 1 failed") could not be reproduced here and appears to have been an earlier, ad-hoc run; please re-run tests in CI or locally to confirm final pass counts.

**Opportunities for Improvement:**

- Develop a robust animation frame mocking utility that supports queuing and flushing callbacks.
  - Phase 0 â€“ Research: Examine existing `requestAnimationFrame` usage across the app and document timing expectations (burst callbacks, idle frames, cancellation).
  - Phase 1 â€“ Specification: Define the mock API (enqueue, flushNext, flushAll, cancel) and concurrency guarantees, including integration points with Vitest fake timers.
  - Phase 2 â€“ Implementation: Build the utility with an internal queue and instrumentation counters, plus snapshot-based unit tests that assert ordering and cancellation semantics.
  - Phase 3 â€“ Integration: Replace brittle inline mocks with the utility, updating tests to use explicit flush calls and verifying no regressions in scheduling-sensitive suites.

- Standardize the use of fake timers in tests to avoid global API mocking.
  - Phase 0 â€“ Assessment: Audit the suite for places replacing `setTimeout`, `requestAnimationFrame`, or scheduler internals manually; record incompatibilities with fake timers.
  - Phase 1 â€“ Playbook: Publish a canonical setup/teardown snippet (e.g., `vi.useFakeTimers(); afterEach(vi.useRealTimers);`) and guidance on async helpers like `vi.runAllTimersAsync()`.
  - Phase 2 â€“ Migration: Update critical classic battle and scheduler tests to adopt the playbook, ensuring helper utilities also assume fake timers by default.

- Enhance the scheduler module with test-friendly hooks for deterministic control.
  - Phase 1 â€“ API Design: Propose optional hooks such as `withTestController` or dependency injection for the timing source, and review with maintainers for backward compatibility.
  - Phase 2 â€“ Implementation: Introduce the hooks guarded by internal flags, update scheduler docs, and ensure production codepaths remain unaffected through regression tests.
  - Phase 3 â€“ Test Adoption: Retrofit existing scheduler-focused tests to use the hooks, eliminating reliance on private internals or monkey-patching.

- Add safeguards in the scheduler to detect and prevent infinite loops during testing.
  - Phase 1 â€“ Safeguard Design: Define detection heuristics (max synchronous frame depth, loop duration thresholds) and decide on developer-facing warnings vs. hard failures.
  - Phase 2 â€“ Implementation: Add guarded counters or watchdog timers within the scheduler, ensuring they can be toggled or relaxed for stress tests.
  - Phase 3 â€“ Verification: Create targeted tests that intentionally trigger the safeguards to confirm they surface actionable diagnostics without false positives.

## Consolidated Opportunities for Improvement (scored & ranked)

Below are all opportunities for improvement from the three failure analyses consolidated into a single list. Each item has a short summary, an estimated implementation complexity score (1 = very small, 5 = very large), and a rationale. Items are ranked from least complex to most complex.

1. Improve shared test mocking utilities (score: 1)

- Summary: Create small helper factories for common UI components (stat buttons, snackbar) and realistic DOM-interaction mocks (attach handlers, disabled state, aria attributes).
- Why low complexity: Mostly test-only code, limited impact surface, quick wins by extracting and reusing patterns already present in tests.

2. Add a queue-based animation frame mock helper (score: 1)

- Summary: Extract the queue-based RAF mock implemented in `tests/helpers/classicBattle/utils.js` into a reusable helper with `enqueue`, `flushNext`, `flushAll`, and `cancel` APIs.
- Why low complexity: Implemented already in-line; packaging and small tests required.

3. Publish a fake-timers playbook & canonical test setup (score: 2)

- Summary: Document and add a standard setup/teardown pattern (e.g., `vi.useFakeTimers()` and `afterEach(vi.useRealTimers)`) and recommended async helper usage like `vi.runAllTimersAsync()`.
- Why moderate: Documentation + small infra changes and updating CI snippets; low code risk.

4. Shared mock helpers for high-traffic UI components (score: 2)

- Summary: Build robust factories for complex interactive components (scoreboard, stat buttons, modals) that tests can opt into.
- Why moderate: Adds test utilities but requires cross-repo QA to ensure helpers cover required behaviors.

5. Add test assertions / utilities to verify event listener wiring (score: 2)

- Summary: Provide helpers like `expectListenerAttached` or `getRegisteredHandlers` to make tests assert listeners are present after initialization.
- Why moderate: Small test harness code with limited surface area; improves test reliability.

6. Replace brittle inline mocks with integration-style refactors for priority tests (score: 3)

- Summary: For the flakiest tests, remove deep mocking and move to integration-focused tests that use real modules + deterministic fakes (timers, fixtures).
- Why higher complexity: Requires test rewrites and coordination; improves long-term stability.

7. Centralize round state management / single source of truth (score: 4)

- Summary: Introduce a small battle-session store (observable or light state manager) for canonical round number management consumed by UI, orchestrator, and analytics.
- Why high complexity: Cross-cutting change touching runtime code, event flows, and many consumers â€” requires feature-flagged rollout and migration tests.

8. Scheduler test-friendly hooks & deterministic control (score: 4)

- Summary: Add optional hooks to the scheduler (e.g., inject timing source, `withTestController`) so tests can deterministically control frames and pause/resume behavior without mocking globals.
- Why high complexity: Modifies production scheduler API and needs careful backwards compatibility and test migration.

9. Add scheduler safeguards to detect/prevent infinite loops (score: 5)

- Summary: Implement watchdog counters or max synchronous frame depth heuristics in the scheduler to surface actionable diagnostics or fail safely in tests.
- Why highest complexity: Changes runtime scheduler behavior; requires careful design to avoid false positives and ensure production performance remains unaffected.

Notes on ranking & scoring:

- Scores are implementation complexity estimates that factor engineering effort, risk to production code, and cross-team coordination.
- Short-term wins: items 1â€“3 are quick to implement and will reduce flakiness rapidly.
- Medium-term: items 4â€“6 require more coordination but substantially improve test health.
- Long-term: items 7â€“9 touch production code and APIs and should be done behind feature flags with thorough validation.

Suggested next steps / verification checklist:

1. Run the `page-scaffold` tests locally without filtering/skipping to validate runtime behavior:

- From repository root run:

  ```bash
  npx vitest run tests/classicBattle/page-scaffold.test.js
  ```

- If Vitest reports the file as skipped, search for any `describe.skip`/`test.skip` or environment gating that may be preventing execution.

2. If timeouts persist for the "render enabled after start; clicking resolves and starts cooldown" test, re-run that single test with verbose output and trace the listener wiring. Useful steps:

- Ensure `initStatButtons` mock is the one being executed (the file-level mock is present; cross-module mocks can mask it).
- Add temporary `console.log` (or a muted test log gate) to verify the click handler is attached and that `handleStatSelection` is called.

3. Once the small, test-only fixes are validated, consider extracting the RAF mock and common test helpers into `tests/helpers/*` to reduce duplication and improve reuse (low-risk refactor).

4. For the longer-term architectural suggestion (centralized round state), open a separate design spike/PR so we can discuss API surface and migration strategy; this remains recommended but out-of-scope for the quick test fixes applied here.

5. Report back with the Vitest output (or CI job) and I will update this document to record final pass/fail numbers and close outstanding items.
