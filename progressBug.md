# QA Report for battleCLI.html

| Issue                                      | Steps to reproduce                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Expected vs. actual                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Difficult start flow**                   | 1. Load `battleCLI.html`. 2. Click the yellow power button. 3. A *Select Match Length* dialog appears, but after choosing, nothing happens until the user clicks the power button again.                                                                                            | PRD expects a clearly labelled "Start match" control or immediate start once the match length is selected. The current UI requires two separate clicks on an unlabeled icon, which is unintuitive. |
| **Score does not update**                  | Start a match with a seed (e.g., 42), select stats over multiple rounds. The outcome message occasionally shows a tie (e.g., `Tie – no score! (Technique – You: 8 Opponent: 8)`), but after many rounds the `You` and `Opponent` scores in the top‑right scoreboard remain `0 : 0`. | Winning or losing rounds should increment scores. Either the score is never updated or the outcome message is rarely visible.                                                                      |
| **Outcome messages disappear too quickly** | After selecting a stat, a resolution message (win/tie/loss) flashes for a brief moment and is overwritten by the next round. If the player is not watching the exact area, the feedback is missed.                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Quit confirmation fails**                | Press `Q` during a round. A modal appears with `Cancel` and `Quit`. Clicking `Quit` does not exit the match; the modal disappears and the match continues. Only pressing `Esc` exits to the home page.                                                                              | According to the PRD, `Q` should allow quitting mid‑match. The button may not be wired correctly.                                                                                                  |
| **Verbose mode unclear**                   | Toggling the `Verbose` checkbox does not visibly change the interface. In PRD the verbose flag should output extra round details; no difference was observed.                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Timer resets unexpectedly**              | When the round timer expires without a selection, the next round starts but the round number does not increase, and the timer resets. It’s unclear whether missing the timer results in a penalty or auto‑selection.                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **State badge/observability hidden**       | The PRD mentions a `State:` label that displays the internal battle state when the flag `battleStateBadge` is on. In the CLI UI this badge remains blank and there is no setting to enable it.                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Accessibility & ARIA**                   | Without a screen reader it’s hard to verify ARIA‑live announcements. However, there are no visible labels on the power icon or match‑length buttons, which may be problematic for screen readers.                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Improvement Opportunities

*   **Clear start control** – Replace the yellow power icon with an explicit "Start match" button. After selecting the match length, the match should start automatically without requiring another click.
*   **Visible outcome feedback** – Keep the result message and stat comparison displayed until the player confirms the next round (e.g., press Enter/Space). This prevents important information from being missed.
*   **Fix scoring bug** – Investigate why scores remain at 0 : 0 despite several rounds. Ensure the scoreboard updates in real time and reaches the win target.
*   **Quit workflow** – Ensure that clicking Quit in the quit dialog ends the match and returns to the main menu. Optionally allow Q to quit directly when the dialog is shown.
*   **Verbose flag** – If enabled, include detailed breakdowns (stat values compared, remaining health, etc.) either in the main log or below the stat cards. When disabled, keep the interface minimal.
*   **Accessible labels** – Add aria-label attributes and focus outlines to the power button and match‑length options. Provide descriptive alt‑text for the timer and scoreboard. The State badge should also update when the internal state changes.
*   **Keyboard hint** – Display a prompt such as Press 1–5 to choose a stat near the stat cards when waiting for input. Use ARIA‑live to announce this to screen readers.
*   **Timer behaviour** – Clarify in the UI what happens if the timer expires. Either auto‑select the highest stat or mark it as a loss; communicate this to the player.
*   **Match length selection** – After choosing match length, hide the settings panel to focus on the match. Consider allowing match length to be changed only before starting, not mid‑match.

Recommendations
Fix scoring and outcome persistence – Investigate whether the round resolution events (battleRoundWon, battleRoundLost) are being emitted and handled in the CLI. Update the scoreboard and maintain the outcome message until the next input.
Simplify the start flow – Combine match‑length selection and match start into one interaction or provide clear instructions. Consider a dedicated modal with step‑by‑step prompts.
Improve quit and escape handling – The quit dialog should be fully functional and accessible. Pressing Q twice or clicking Quit should reliably exit. Esc should show confirmation instead of instantly exiting.
Expose and document feature flags – Provide toggles or URL parameters for battleStateBadge, observabilityMode and autoSelect per the PRD. Use them to aid debugging and automated testing.
Enhance accessibility – Add screen‑reader labels to all interactive controls, ensure ARIA‑live regions announce state changes, and support focus management when dialogs open/close. Provide high‑contrast outlines for selected stat cards.
Timer behaviour – Define behaviour for timeout clearly (auto‑select, forfeit or random). If it auto‑selects, display which stat was chosen. If it results in a loss, display a message and update the score accordingly.
Test automation hooks – As recommended in the PRD, expose deterministic callbacks (e.g., to start a round, resolve a round, or fetch the internal state) on window to facilitate automated QA. Logging hooks can output the current state, timers and event payloads.
