## Summary

This document captures the investigation and mitigation work performed to diagnose and fix a Vitest hook-timeout observed in `tests/helpers/classicBattle/uiHelpers.missingElements.test.js`. It records the root cause analysis, actions taken, verification status, and recommended next steps (short-term and medium-term fixes).

## Problem statement

- Symptom: Vitest failure with "Error: Hook timed out in 10000ms" pointing at the global `beforeEach` in `tests/setup.js`.
- Affected tests: `uiHelpers element assertions` (two failing tests initially), and additional intermittent per-test timeouts observed after fixes.

## Root cause (analysis)

- The global `beforeEach` in `tests/setup.js` awaited a dynamic import of `src/helpers/classicBattle.js` and then awaited `__ensureClassicBattleBindings()` exported by the module's `testHooks` helper.
- Many test files use `vi.resetModules()` in their own file-level hooks. That resets module-level state and can race with a global awaited dynamic import/rebind. The awaited call could never resolve in some ordering, causing the global hook to hang and time out.
- `promises.js` attaches test synchronization promises to `window` (for example `window.roundPromptPromise`). Those promises and event handlers are created or reset by `__ensureClassicBattleBindings()` and `reset` helpers; improper ordering leaves tests waiting on promises that never get resolved.

## Actions taken (what I changed and why)

1. Reproduced the failing test locally with verbose logs to confirm the stack trace and the blocking await location.
2. Read and audited the key modules:
	- `tests/setup.js` (global harness)
	- `src/helpers/classicBattle.js`
	- `src/helpers/classicBattle/testHooks.js`
	- `src/helpers/classicBattle/promises.js`, `roundUI.js`, and `uiHelpers.js` (to understand what get bound)
3. Added temporary debug logs in `tests/setup.js` to confirm dynamic import and ensure calls were reached (then removed transient logs from production code).
4. Iteratively modified `tests/setup.js` to avoid awaiting the heavy/racy initialization in the global `beforeEach`:
	- Tried force-ensuring bindings and explicit resets.
	- Tried deferring import with `setTimeout(..., 0)` to avoid tick-order races.
	- Final pragmatic change: switched to a fire-and-forget dynamic import inside the global `beforeEach` and invoked `__resetClassicBattleBindings()` followed by `__ensureClassicBattleBindings({ force: true })` without awaiting. This guarantees the global hook does not block while still preloading bindings in the background.
5. Removed temporary debug statements added to source modules during diagnosis.

Files touched: primarily `tests/setup.js` (global harness). Temporary debug additions to `src/helpers/classicBattle/testHooks.js` and `src/helpers/classicBattle.js` were removed.

## Verification & current status

- After the non-blocking preload change, the original 10s global `beforeEach` hook timeout no longer reproduces. The test runner proceeds into the test bodies.
- Test runs now show fewer hook failures. However, some per-test timeouts (smaller, ~5s test-level timeouts) and intermittent failing assertions remain. These are distinct and likely related to test-level synchronization (e.g., promises in `promises.js` or resolvers in button/next-button flows).
- The risk of regressing other tests was minimized by keeping the global change non-blocking and by avoiding structural changes to the classic-battle API.

Current status: Global hook-timeout Root Cause: Resolved (mitigated). Remaining: per-test timeouts and failing assertions—next focus.

## Short-term recommendations (practical, low-risk)

1. Keep the non-blocking fire-and-forget preload in `tests/setup.js` so the global `beforeEach` never waits for the rebind. Tests that need bindings should explicitly await `__ensureClassicBattleBindings()` locally in their own `beforeEach` when deterministic ordering is required.
2. While debugging failing tests, temporarily increase the per-test timeout for problem tests to capture failure traces (use `test(..., { timeout: 20000 })` or Vitest CLI flags) so the failing promise point is exposed.
3. Add focused, isolated test runs for the failing tests to capture logs and stack traces (run the individual test file rather than the whole suite).

Commands to run (examples):

```bash
# run a single test file (verbose) to reproduce and capture logs
npx vitest run tests/helpers/classicBattle/uiHelpers.missingElements.test.js --reporter verbose

# run all tests (CI style)
npx vitest
```

## Medium-term / recommended fixes (less-risk, more robust)

1. Add a tiny synchronous test-only initializer exported from `src/helpers/classicBattle/testHooks.js`, for example `initializeTestBindingsLight()`:
	- Purpose: set minimal deterministic module-level state and attach the minimal promises/event target synchronously, so global `beforeEach` can call it without async awaits and without races with `vi.resetModules()`.
	- Populate only what tests truly need in common (avoid importing heavy modules or starting timers).
	- Use `/* @test-only */` JSDoc or a clearly-named export so production code doesn't rely on it.
2. Refactor tests that call `vi.resetModules()` widely:
	- Replace full module resets with targeted stubs/mocks where possible.
	- When `vi.resetModules()` is required, ensure the test calls the test-hooks `__ensureClassicBattleBindings()` (or the lightweight initializer) in its own `beforeEach` to get deterministic state.
3. Add unit/integration tests that explicitly exercise the promise reset/resolve flows in `promises.js` to prevent regressions. Include a happy-path and 1-2 edge cases (no-event, repeated reset) per the repo test-quality standards.

## Concrete next steps (what I can do next)

I can proceed with one or more of the following; pick which you want me to do next:

1. Implement the synchronous lightweight initializer (`initializeTestBindingsLight()`) in `src/helpers/classicBattle/testHooks.js` and wire `tests/setup.js` to call it synchronously. Then run the test suite and iterate on any remaining failures.
2. Investigate the remaining per-test timeouts one-by-one:
	- Run failing tests in isolation with extended timeouts and full logs.
	- Instrument the exact promise/resolver paths (e.g., `window.__resolveStatButtonsReady`) to ensure they get called.
3. Create small targeted tests for `promises.js` to assert that reset/resolve semantics work as expected (happy path + reset edge-case).
4. Audit tests that call `vi.resetModules()` and provide a short patch to convert a small set to targeted mocks instead; propose a plan for broader follow-up.

If you want me to proceed immediately, say which option (1–4) to start with and I will implement it, run tests, and iterate until green or until I'm blocked and need your input.

## Acceptance criteria for final resolution

- The global `beforeEach` hook should never block waiting for dynamic rebinds (PASS: no 10s hook timeouts).
- Tests that need classic-battle bindings should either explicitly await a binding helper locally in their `beforeEach` or rely on a documented lightweight synchronous initializer.
- All tests in the affected area (classic battle helpers) should be stable and deterministic in CI (no intermittent timeouts or race failures).

## Notes / Observations

- The current mitigation trades deterministic global ordering for resilience: it avoids blocking but requires tests that rely on bindings to be explicit. This is a pragmatic short-term fix to unblock test runs without changing the public API or introducing risky refactors.
- A small test-only synchronous initializer is the cleanest long-term fix: it preserves deterministic global setup without awaiting heavy dynamic imports and avoids races with `vi.resetModules()`.
