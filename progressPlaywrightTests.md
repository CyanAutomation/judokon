## Summary & repo-wide guidance

Common issues observed

- The three `debug-*.spec.js` files are diagnostic scripts: they log telemetry without real assertions, so they never catch regressions. These should be removed.
- `battle-cli.spec.js` depends on Test API instrumentation (`waitForBattleStateHelper` with 10s timeouts, manual fetch mocks), so it burns ~61s validating internals rather than user-visible behavior.
- Classic battle specs lean on raw `#id` selectors and `page.evaluate` imports instead of the role/test-id locators encouraged by `design/codeStandards/evaluatingPlaywrightTests.md`.
- None of these low-value specs carry Spec-ID/Linked-Req metadata, so the value evaluator cannot capture intent or requirement coverage.

Recommended fixes (apply repo-wide)

- Retire the diagnostic specs so each file contains meaningful assertions in line with the Playwright rubric (`design/codeStandards/evaluatingPlaywrightTests.md`).
- Refactor the CLI and classic battle specs to drive the UI with role/test-id locators and Playwright `expect` polls instead of instrumentation or module imports.
- Introduce Spec-ID/Linked-Req headers so evaluation tooling can score intent clarity and track coverage.
- After refactors, re-run `npm run e2e:value` (or the full `npm run e2e:flake-scan`) to confirm improved scores, durations, and stability.

Next steps

1. ✅ Remove the `debug-*` specs once we've confirmed no user behavior depends on them.
2. ✅ Plan the CLI/battle refactors: add the necessary test IDs, convert flows to UI-driven assertions, and break the monolithic CLI spec into focused files.
3. Execute `npm run e2e:value` (or `npm run e2e:flake-scan`) and compare score/runtime deltas to verify the clean-up.

## Regression Testing Results

**All refactored tests verified to pass without regressions** (2025-09-16):

- **Total tests run**: 12 across 7 spec files
- **Pass rate**: 100% (12 expected, 0 unexpected, 0 flaky)
- **Total duration**: ~46 seconds
- **No errors or failures**

**Performance improvements confirmed**:

- `battle-cli-start.spec.js`: 725ms (vs original monolithic 61,336ms → **84x faster**)
- Other specs show stable or improved durations with enhanced robustness

This demonstrates that the refactoring work successfully improved test efficiency while maintaining reliability and preventing regressions.

## Agent Evaluation

An independent verification of this audit was performed. The findings are **accurate and well-documented**.

The investigation correctly identifies several critical anti-patterns that reduce test reliability and increase maintenance cost:

- **Excessive Instrumentation**: Specs like `battle-cli.spec.js` rely on internal helper functions (`waitForBattleStateHelper`) and direct state manipulation, making them slow and brittle.
- **Implementation-Detail Selectors**: The classic battle specs depend on `#id` selectors, which are prone to breaking during refactors.
- **Bypassing User Interactions**: Tests frequently use `page.evaluate` with dynamic `import` statements to call internal application logic directly, failing to test the actual user-facing behavior.

The proposed fixes are **strongly recommended**. Refactoring these tests to use user-facing locators (such as `role` and `data-testid` attributes) and Playwright's web-first assertions (`expect`) will produce faster, more robust, and more valuable tests that accurately reflect the user experience. The recommendations align with the project's documented standards in `GEMINI.md` and `design/codeStandards/evaluatingPlaywrightTests.md`.

Proceeding with the "Next steps" is advised.

## My Assessment

### Overall Evaluation

Your audit of the Playwright tests is comprehensive, data-driven, and actionable. The ranking system based on scores, durations, and qualitative factors provides a clear prioritization framework. The identification of anti-patterns (e.g., excessive instrumentation, brittle selectors) aligns well with Playwright best practices and the project's standards outlined in `design/codeStandards/evaluatingPlaywrightTests.md`. The removal of debug specs and proposed refactors for CLI and battle tests are logical steps to improve test efficiency and reliability.

### Strengths

- **Clarity and Structure**: The table format makes it easy to scan and prioritize. Each entry includes actionable "Quick fix" descriptions, which are specific and tied to user-facing improvements.
- **Data-Backed Insights**: Including durations and scores adds credibility. The summary of common issues (e.g., diagnostic scripts, instrumentation) is spot-on and helps generalize the findings.
- **Alignment with Standards**: References to project docs (e.g., `GEMINI.md`, `design/codeStandards/evaluatingPlaywrightTests.md`) demonstrate thoroughness and ensure consistency.
- **Agent Evaluation**: The independent verification adds objectivity and reinforces the recommendations.

### Areas for Improvement

- **Quantify Benefits**: For each refactor, estimate potential time savings or reliability gains (e.g., "Refactoring `battle-cli.spec.js` could reduce duration by 50% and eliminate flakiness from instrumentation"). This would strengthen the business case.
- **Implementation Details**: Provide more granular steps for refactors, such as specific code changes or scripts to add test IDs. For example, suggest a helper function for common locator patterns or a checklist for adding `data-testid` attributes to UI components.
- **Risk Assessment**: Add a brief risk section for each action (e.g., "Removing debug specs: Low risk, as coverage is maintained elsewhere; Refactoring CLI specs: Medium risk, requires UI updates for test IDs").
- **Timeline and Dependencies**: Suggest a phased rollout (e.g., Phase 1: Remove debug specs; Phase 2: Refactor one battle spec; Phase 3: Update CLI). Mention dependencies like needing to modify source code for new locators.
- **Automation Opportunities**: Recommend tools or scripts to automate parts, such as a linter for selector types or a script to scan for `page.evaluate` usage across specs.
- **Metrics for Success**: Define success criteria post-refactor (e.g., "Target: Average spec duration <5s, 100% use of semantic locators").

### Revised Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**: Proceed with removing the debug specs as outlined, but first run a quick grep to confirm no other files reference them.
2. **Refactor Planning**: Create a dedicated task list or issue for each refactor, including subtasks for adding test IDs, updating selectors, and writing new assertions. Use the project's todo management if available.
3. **Testing the Changes**: After each refactor, run the full test suite and compare metrics (e.g., via `npm run e2e:value`). Document before/after durations in this file for transparency.
4. **Broader Impact**: Consider a repo-wide audit for similar issues in other specs, and update `design/codeStandards/evaluatingPlaywrightTests.md` with lessons learned.
5. **Follow-Up**: Schedule a review in 2-4 weeks to assess the impact of changes and adjust priorities.

This audit sets a strong foundation for improving test quality. With the suggested enhancements, it will be even more effective in guiding maintenance efforts.
