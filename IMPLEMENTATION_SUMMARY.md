# AGENTS.md Updates - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

---

## Overview

All recommended improvements from the review have been successfully applied to AGENTS.md. The üéØ Battle Pages Regression Testing section has been enhanced with critical fixes and medium-priority improvements.

---

## Changes Applied

### 1. ‚úÖ CRITICAL: Fixed npm Command Typo

**Location:** Common Workflows section - "When adding a feature to CLI Battle"

**Before:**
```bash
npm run test:battles:cli:watch
npm run test:battles:cli        # Final check
```

**After:**
```bash
npm run test:battles:watch      # Watch mode during development
npm run test:battles:cli        # Final check
```

**Impact:** Prevents users from attempting to run a non-existent command. This was the only critical error in the recommendations.

---

### 2. ‚úÖ MEDIUM: Added Cross-References to Related Sections

**Location:** Beginning of Battle Pages Regression Testing section

**Added:**
```markdown
**Related sections:** For general Classic Battle test patterns, see [‚öîÔ∏è Classic Battle Testing](#Ô∏è-classic-battle-testing). For Playwright interaction patterns, see [üé≠ Playwright Test Quality Standards](#-playwright-test-quality-standards).
```

**Impact:** Helps agents navigate between related documentation sections, reducing duplication and improving discoverability.

---

### 3. ‚úÖ MEDIUM: Added Test Scope Clarification

**Location:** New subsection "What's NOT Included in Battle Tests"

**Added:**
```markdown
### What's NOT Included in Battle Tests

These battle-specific tests focus on page workflows and user interactions. Other test categories cover:

- **General UI component tests** ‚Äî See `tests/components/`
- **Data validation tests** ‚Äî See `tests/data/`
- **Helper function tests (non-battle)** ‚Äî See `tests/helpers/`
- **Utility and library tests** ‚Äî See other test directories
```

**Impact:** Provides clear boundaries for what the battle pages test suite covers, reducing confusion about test organization.

---

### 4. ‚úÖ MEDIUM: Added Debugging Guide

**Location:** New subsection "Debugging Test Failures" (after Key Validation Commands)

**Added:**
```markdown
### Debugging Test Failures

If battle tests fail after your changes:

1. **Identify which test failed:** Run `npm run test:battles:watch` to watch and locate the failing test
2. **Verify it's not flaky:** Run the test again with `npm run test:battles` to confirm the failure is consistent
3. **Review your changes:** Compare your modifications to the affected page (battleClassic.html or battleCLI.html)
4. **Check dependencies:** If you changed files in `tests/battles-regressions/shared/`, both Classic and CLI tests may be affected
```

**Impact:** Provides practical troubleshooting steps for agents when battle tests fail, reducing debugging time.

---
