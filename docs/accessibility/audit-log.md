# Battle CLI Accessibility Audit Log

## 2025-??-?? — Automated Agent Pass
- **Executor:** Codex QA agent (sandboxed environment)
- **Scope:** Battle CLI live-region behaviour, round confirmation prompts, countdown announcements.
- **Verification:**
  - `npx vitest run tests/pages/battleCLI.accessibilityLiveRegions.test.js`
  - `npx playwright test playwright/cli.spec.js --reporter=line --workers=1`
- **Outcome:** Automated checks confirm polite live-regions on round updates, focus moves to the “Next” control after manual round completion, and countdown announcements stay in sync. No regressions detected.
- **Manual Screen Reader Status:** VoiceOver/NVDA audit not executed (assistive technologies unavailable inside sandbox). Follow-up required by human QA per plan in `progressCLI.md`.
