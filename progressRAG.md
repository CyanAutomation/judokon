# RAG System Evaluation & Remediation Report

## 1. Objective

The goal was to test the RAG vector database's access tools and provide a thorough evaluation of its readiness and efficacy for use by AI agents.

## 2. Initial State

The project contained a RAG system with an embeddings file (`client_embeddings.json`), an embedding generation script (`scripts/generateEmbeddings.js`), a quantitative evaluation script (`scripts/evaluation/evaluateRAG.js`), and a CLI query tool (`scripts/queryRagCli.mjs`). The system's actual performance and the readiness of its tooling were unknown.

## 3. Investigation & Actions Taken

The evaluation process involved a sequence of debugging steps to uncover a systemic issue with the project's tooling.

### Step 1: Quantitative Evaluation Failure

- **Action:** Ran the primary evaluation script: `node scripts/evaluation/evaluateRAG.js`.
- **Result:** The script failed immediately.
- **Analysis:** The error message (`Could not locate file: "https://huggingface.co/file:///..."`) indicated that the script was incorrectly creating a `file://` URL for the local model, which the `transformers.js` library was then prepending with the Hugging Face domain.

### Step 2: First Fix Attempt

- **Action:** Replaced the faulty `loadModel` function in `evaluateRAG.js` with the more robust version found in `generateEmbeddings.js`.
- **Result:** The script failed again, but with a new error: `Failed to load model because protobuf parsing failed`.
- **Analysis:** This new error suggested that the script could now find the model files, but the files themselves were corrupted or incomplete.

### Step 3: Model Cache Inspection & Regeneration

- **Action:** Inspected the local model cache directory with `ls -lR models/minilm`.
- **Result:** The inspection revealed that the core model file (`model_quantized.onnx`) was 0 bytes, confirming a corrupted cache.
- **Analysis:** The model needed to be cleared and re-downloaded.
- **Action:**
    1. Deleted the corrupted directory: `rm -rf models/minilm`.
    2. Ran the embedding generation script `npm run generate:embeddings` to trigger a fresh download.

### Step 4: Root Cause Discovery

- **Action:** Re-ran the patched evaluation script.
- **Result:** The script now ran without crashing but returned `0` for all quality metrics (MRR, Recall). It also produced a `Local model not found` warning.
- **Analysis:** An `ls -lR models` command revealed the `models` directory was still empty. The download process was not placing the model in the expected local directory but rather in a hidden global cache. The zero-scores were caused by the embedding script and the evaluation script using two different, separately cached instances of the model.
- **Action:** To get a true test, I pivoted to using the end-user tool: `node scripts/queryRagCli.mjs`.
- **Result:** The CLI tool failed with the **exact same `file://` pathing error** as the original evaluation script.
- **Analysis:** This confirmed the model-loading bug was systemic. I traced the dependency from the CLI script to `src/helpers/queryRag.js` and finally to `src/helpers/api/vectorSearchPage.js`.

### Step 5: Definitive Fix

- **Action:** Applied the robust model-loading logic to the single, centralized `getExtractor` function within `src/helpers/api/vectorSearchPage.js`.
- **Result:** All dependent scripts were now corrected.
- **Action:** Ran the `queryRagCli.mjs` tool one last time.
- **Result:** The query was **successful**, returning relevant and actionable results.

## 4. Final Analysis & Current State

*   **Efficacy:** The core RAG system is **effective**. A qualitative test showed it successfully retrieves relevant documents that connect a user's query to specific data files and components in the codebase.
*   **Readiness:**
    *   **Core System & Query Tools (✅ Ready):** The embedding generation and the primary `queryRag` function are now working correctly.
    *   **Quantitative Evaluation (`evaluateRAG.js`) (❌ Not Ready):** The evaluation script is still broken and produces misleading zero-score results due to the model caching discrepancy.

## 5. Next Step Recommendations

To arrive at a fully effective and maintainable RAG system, the following next step is crucial:

1.  **Refactor the Evaluation Script (`scripts/evaluation/evaluateRAG.js`):**
    *   **Problem:** The script's methodology of loading a separate model instance to generate embeddings on-the-fly is fundamentally flawed due to the library's caching behavior.
    *   **Recommendation:** Modify the script to stop loading a model entirely. Instead, it should import and use the now-functional `queryRag` helper from `src/helpers/queryRag.js`. It should iterate through its test queries, pass each one to `queryRag`, and then check if the expected source appears in the returned results. This will provide a true, end-to-end evaluation of the system as it is actually used by agents.

### Planned Action: Refactor `scripts/evaluation/evaluateRAG.js`

- **Action:** Modify `scripts/evaluation/evaluateRAG.js` to remove direct model loading and instead import and utilize the `queryRag` function from `../../src/helpers/queryRag.js`. This will ensure the evaluation uses the same RAG pipeline as the agents.
- **Expected Outcome:** The script will run successfully and provide meaningful MRR and Recall scores, reflecting the true performance of the RAG system.
