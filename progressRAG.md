# RAG System Evaluation & Remediation Report

## 1. Objective

The goal was to test the RAG vector database's access tools and provide a thorough evaluation of its readiness and efficacy for use by AI agents.

## 2. Initial State

The project contained a RAG system with an embeddings file (`client_embeddings.json`), an embedding generation script (`scripts/generateEmbeddings.js`), a quantitative evaluation script (`scripts/evaluation/evaluateRAG.js`), and a CLI query tool (`scripts/queryRagCli.mjs`). The system's actual performance and the readiness of its tooling were unknown.

## 3. Investigation & Actions Taken

The evaluation process involved a sequence of debugging steps to uncover a systemic issue with the project's tooling.

### Step 1: Quantitative Evaluation Failure

- **Action:** Ran the primary evaluation script: `node scripts/evaluation/evaluateRAG.js`.
- **Result:** The script failed immediately.
- **Analysis:** The error message (`Could not locate file: "https://huggingface.co/file:///..."`) indicated that the script was incorrectly creating a `file://` URL for the local model, which the `transformers.js` library was then prepending with the Hugging Face domain.

### Step 2: First Fix Attempt

- **Action:** Replaced the faulty `loadModel` function in `evaluateRAG.js` with the more robust version found in `generateEmbeddings.js`.
- **Result:** The script failed again, but with a new error: `Failed to load model because protobuf parsing failed`.
- **Analysis:** This new error suggested that the script could now find the model files, but the files themselves were corrupted or incomplete.

### Step 3: Model Cache Inspection & Regeneration

- **Action:** Inspected the local model cache directory with `ls -lR models/minilm`.
- **Result:** The inspection revealed that the core model file (`model_quantized.onnx`) was 0 bytes, confirming a corrupted cache.
- **Analysis:** The model needed to be cleared and re-downloaded.
- **Action:**
    1. Deleted the corrupted directory: `rm -rf models/minilm`.
    2. Ran the embedding generation script `npm run generate:embeddings` to trigger a fresh download.

### Step 4: Root Cause Discovery

- **Action:** Re-ran the patched evaluation script.
- **Result:** The script now ran without crashing but returned `0` for all quality metrics (MRR, Recall). It also produced a `Local model not found` warning.
- **Analysis:** An `ls -lR models` command revealed the `models` directory was still empty. The download process was not placing the model in the expected local directory but rather in a hidden global cache. The zero-scores were caused by the embedding script and the evaluation script using two different, separately cached instances of the model.
- **Action:** To get a true test, I pivoted to using the end-user tool: `node scripts/queryRagCli.mjs`.
- **Result:** The CLI tool failed with the **exact same `file://` pathing error** as the original evaluation script.
- **Analysis:** This confirmed the model-loading bug was systemic. I traced the dependency from the CLI script to `src/helpers/queryRag.js` and finally to `src/helpers/api/vectorSearchPage.js`.

### Step 5: Definitive Fix

- **Action:** Applied the robust model-loading logic to the single, centralized `getExtractor` function within `src/helpers/api/vectorSearchPage.js`.
- **Result:** All dependent scripts were now corrected.
- **Action:** Ran the `queryRagCli.mjs` tool one last time.
- **Result:** The query was **successful**, returning relevant and actionable results.

## 4. Final Analysis & Current State

*   **Efficacy:** The core RAG system is **effective**. A qualitative test showed it successfully retrieves relevant documents that connect a user's query to specific data files and components in the codebase.
*   **Readiness:**
    *   **Core System & Query Tools (✅ Ready):** The embedding generation and the primary `queryRag` function are now working correctly.
    *   **Quantitative Evaluation (`evaluateRAG.js`) (❌ Not Ready):** The evaluation script is still broken and produces misleading zero-score results due to the model caching discrepancy.

## 5. Next Step Recommendations

To arrive at a fully effective and maintainable RAG system, the following next step is crucial:

1.  **Refactor the Evaluation Script (`scripts/evaluation/evaluateRAG.js`):**
    *   **Problem:** The script's methodology of loading a separate model instance to generate embeddings on-the-fly is fundamentally flawed due to the library's caching behavior.
    *   **Recommendation:** Modify the script to stop loading a model entirely. Instead, it should import and use the now-functional `queryRag` helper from `src/helpers/queryRag.js`. It should iterate through its test queries, pass each one to `queryRag`, and then check if the expected source appears in the returned results. This will provide a true, end-to-end evaluation of the system as it is actually used by agents.

### Planned Action: Refactor `scripts/evaluation/evaluateRAG.js`

- **Action:** Modify `scripts/evaluation/evaluateRAG.js` to remove direct model loading and instead import and utilize the `queryRag` function from `../../src/helpers/queryRag.js`. This will ensure the evaluation uses the same RAG pipeline as the agents.
- **Expected Outcome:** The script will run successfully and provide meaningful MRR and Recall scores, reflecting the true performance of the RAG system.

### Action Taken: Refactored `scripts/evaluation/evaluateRAG.js`

- **Action:** Overwrote `scripts/evaluation/evaluateRAG.js` with the refactored code that uses `queryRag`.
- **Outcome:** The script executed successfully, producing the following metrics:
    - `MRR@5: 0.3927`
    - `Recall@3: 0.5`
    - `Recall@5: 0.625`
    These scores indicate a reasonable level of retrieval performance for the RAG system.

### Planned Action: Analyze and Improve Retrieval Quality

- **Action:** Modify `scripts/evaluation/evaluateRAG.js` to log detailed per-query results (query, expected source, rank, top 3 retrieved sources with scores).
- **Expected Outcome:** Detailed logs will enable identification of specific queries where retrieval fails or performs poorly, guiding further optimization efforts.

### Action Taken: Analyzed Detailed Retrieval Results

- **Action:** Ran `node scripts/evaluation/evaluateRAG.js` with detailed logging and analyzed the per-query output.
- **Outcome:** The analysis revealed patterns in retrieval performance:

    **Queries with "Not Found" (Rank 0):**
    *   "settings feature flags order" (Expected: `design/codeStandards/settingsPageDesignGuidelines.md`)
    *   "navbar button transition duration" (Expected: `src/styles/main.css`)
    *   "how to add a new tooltip" (Expected: `src/data/tooltips.json`)
    *   "how are judoka stats calculated" (Expected: `src/data/judoka.json`)
    *   "default navigation items" (Expected: `src/data/navigationItems.js`)
    *   "default sound setting in configuration" (Expected: `src/data/settings.json`)

    **General Observations & Hypotheses:**
    *   **Strength in PRDs/Design Docs:** The RAG system performs well when the expected source is a PRD or a design document. These documents likely contain more descriptive text that aligns well with semantic search.
    *   **Weakness in Specific Code/Data Files:** The system struggles to retrieve specific `.json`, `.js`, or `.css` files, especially when the query asks about "how-to", "calculation", or "default items" that might be implicitly defined by the file's structure rather than explicitly described within a text chunk.
    *   **Chunking Strategy:** The current chunking strategy (especially for JSON and JS files) might not be extracting enough semantic context for these types of queries.
    *   **Query vs. Document Content:** Some queries might be asking for information that isn't explicitly stated in the expected document's indexed chunks, even if the document is the "correct" place to look for the answer.

## 6. Future Work & Continuous Improvement

With the core RAG system and its evaluation now functional, the next steps focus on enhancing its effectiveness and integrating it more deeply into AI agent workflows:

1.  **Analyze and Improve Retrieval Quality:**
    *   **Action:** Review the `scripts/evaluation/queries.json` test cases and the RAG results to identify patterns in retrieval failures or areas with lower scores.
    *   **Recommendation:** Investigate potential improvements such as:
        *   Refining the text chunking strategy in `src/helpers/vectorSearch/chunkConfig.js`.
        *   Expanding the `src/data/synonyms.json` file to improve query understanding.
        *   Adding more diverse or granular data sources to the RAG corpus.

2.  **Integrate RAG into Agent Workflows:**
    *   **Action:** Ensure AI agents are consistently utilizing the `queryRag` tool for relevant queries.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   Develop and refine agent prompts that explicitly guide agents to use the `queryRag` tool for architectural, design, or game rule questions.
        *   Monitor agent logs to track `queryRag` tool usage and analyze its impact on agent performance and accuracy.

### Planned Action: Integrate RAG into Agent Workflows

- **Action:** Confirm that `AGENTS.md` has been updated to guide agents on using the `queryRag` tool. Highlight the need for the user to monitor agent logs for actual usage and impact.
- **Expected Outcome:** Agents will be explicitly instructed to use the RAG system, and the user will have a clear understanding of the monitoring responsibilities.

### Action Taken: Integrate RAG into Agent Workflows

- **Action:** Confirmed that `AGENTS.md` was previously updated with a detailed RAG policy, explicitly guiding agents on when and how to use the `queryRag` tool.
- **Outcome:** Agents are now formally instructed to leverage the RAG system for relevant queries. Monitoring actual agent usage and its impact on performance is an ongoing responsibility for the user, as direct access to agent execution logs is not available to this model.
