# PRD: Classic Battle

**Game Mode ID:** `1`  
**Entry Point:** `battleClassic.html`  
**Shares Engine With:** Battle Engine Core (see [prdBattleEngine.md](prdBattleEngine.md))

---

## TL;DR

Classic Battle is Ju-Do-Kon!’s **introductory head-to-head mode**. It provides a **fast, simple, and rewarding experience** for new players, teaching them how stats drive outcomes while keeping matches short and replayable.

**Experience snapshot:**

> A new player draws her first card. She chooses _Speed_, wins the round, and sees her score tick up. Within minutes, she has learned how stats matter, feels successful, and wants to play again.

---

## Problem Statement

New players need a **low-stakes, easy-to-grasp battle mode** to understand the game’s core loop (draw → choose stat → compare → score). Without it, early retention suffers: players get overwhelmed in complex modes, feel confused, and abandon the game.

Classic Battle solves this by being:

- **Fast** — match start ≤ 5 s after mode selection.
- **Accessible** — guided UI, clear feedback, and generous timers.
- **Engaging** — short matches (≤ 3 min) with visible progress and a satisfying end condition.

**Player feedback example:**

> “I don’t know which stat to pick. I feel like I’ll lose if I guess wrong.” — Playtest participant, age 9

**Baseline Retention Data (for context):**  
Currently, only ~45% of new players complete their first battle across all modes. The target is to raise this to ≥70% completion via Classic Battle.

## Goals

### Player Goals

- Quick, intuitive battles with **clear rules**.
- Learn how judoka stats influence outcomes.
- See immediate, readable **round results** and **score updates**.
- Matches short enough to play in a break (≤ 3 min).
- Ability to **quit early** without penalty or confusion.

### Product Goals

- ≥ 70% of new players complete one Classic Battle in their first session.
- Increase new-user retention by offering a safe practice mode.
- ≥ 40% of players replay Classic Battle within their first session (measurable replayability metric).

---

## Non-Goals

- Online multiplayer.
- Customizable timers or win conditions beyond 3/5/10 points.
- Alternate rulesets, stat weighting, or advanced scoring.

---

## User Stories

- As a **new player**, I want a simple battle mode so I can **learn without pressure**.
- As a **child**, I want colorful, exciting round feedback so I stay engaged.
- As a **player with limited motor control**, I want enough time (30 s) to pick a stat.
- As a **tester**, I want a predictable sequence of states I can hook into.
- As a **player in a hurry**, I want to quit at any point without confusion.

---

## Gameplay Basics

- On first visit to `battleJudoka.html`, a modal prompts the player to select a win target of **3, 5, or 10 points** (default 5). After a choice is made, the modal closes and the match begins.
- The standard deck contains **99 unique cards**.
- Each match begins with both sides receiving **25 random cards**.
- At the start of each round, both players draw their top card.
- The player selects one stat (Power, Speed, Technique, etc.).
- Stat buttons stay disabled until the selection phase and turn off after a choice is made.
- The higher value wins the round and scores **1 point**; used cards are discarded.
- The match ends when a player reaches a **user-selected win target of 3, 5, or 10 points** (default 5) or after **25 rounds** (draw).

### Round UI Flow

Classic Battle emits three deterministic UI events per round that coordinate the stat buttons, Scoreboard, and cooldown timers:

1. **`roundStarted`** — resets button states, preps the countdown timers, and synchronises the Scoreboard (see [Functional Requirements – Scoreboard Integration](#functional-requirements)).
2. **`statSelected`** — highlights the chosen stat button, locks out further picks, and optionally surfaces the "You picked" snackbar referenced in [Technical Considerations](#technical-considerations).
3. **`roundResolved`** — pushes the outcome to the Scoreboard, updates scores, schedules the inter-round countdown, and clears any stat highlight before the next `roundStarted` event.

Round resolution is implemented as a helper chain for clarity and testing hooks. `evaluateOutcome` compares the selected stats, `dispatchOutcomeEvents` moves the battle state forward, `updateScoreboard` keeps UI counters aligned with engine data, and `emitRoundResolved` broadcasts the final result for downstream listeners (e.g., [Feature Flags – `enableTestMode`](#feature-flags)).

To avoid repeated DOM queries inside timers and handlers, the shared round store caches references to the player card, opponent card, stat buttons, and scoreboard containers.

### Headless / Fast-Forward Mode

Automated simulations can enable headless mode to bypass reveal delays and cooldown waits:

```js
import { setHeadlessMode } from "../helpers/headlessMode.js";

setHeadlessMode(true); // skip cooldown and reveal delays
```

When headless mode is active, rounds resolve back-to-back, dramatically increasing throughput for QA suites and feature-flagged diagnostics (see [Functional Requirements – Debug/Testing Mode](#functional-requirements)).

---

## Technical Considerations

- Classic Battle logic must reuse shared random card draw module (`generateRandomCard`).
- Orchestrator initialization preloads timer utilities and UI services, builds the state handler map, then attaches listeners before exposing the machine.
- Round selection modal must use shared `Modal` and `Button` components for consistent accessibility.
- Card reveal and result animations should use hardware-accelerated CSS for smooth performance on low-end devices.
- Stat selection timer (30s) must be displayed in `#next-round-timer`; if the timer expires, a random stat is auto-selected. This auto-select behavior is controlled by a feature flag `autoSelect` (enabled by default). The timer must pause if the game tab is inactive or device goes to sleep, and resume on focus (see prdBattleScoreboard.md).
- Stat selection timer halts immediately once the player picks a stat.
- Detect timer drift by comparing engine state with real time; if drift exceeds 2s, display "Waiting…" and restart the countdown.
- Opponent stat selection runs entirely on the client. After the player picks a stat (or the timer auto-chooses), the opponent's choice is revealed after a short artificial delay to mimic turn-taking.
- During this delay, the Scoreboard displays "Opponent is choosing..." in `#round-message` to reinforce turn flow.
- The cooldown timer between rounds begins only after round results are shown in the Scoreboard and is displayed using one persistent snackbar that updates its text each second.
- The debug panel is available when the `enableTestMode` feature flag is enabled, appears above the player and opponent cards, and includes a copy button for exporting its text.
- A battle state progress list can be enabled via the `battleStateProgress` feature flag to show the sequence of match states beneath the battle area. The list pre-populates from `data-battle-state` and remaps interrupt states to their nearest core state. Disabled by default.

### Round Data Fallback

- Round options are sourced from `battleRounds.js` and bundled with the app.
- **QA:** Validate that options from `battleRounds.js` render correctly.

---

## Feature Flags

- `autoSelect` (default **true**) — auto-pick stat on timeout. (Player-facing default)
- `battleStateProgress` (default **false**) — show state progress list. (Developer/testing only)
- `enableTestMode` (default **false**) — enable debug panel, seed control. (Developer/testing only)
- `statHotkeys` (default **false**) — allow keyboard 1–5 for stat buttons. (Optional player-facing)
- `skipRoundCooldown` (default **false**) — bypass inter-round cooldown. (Developer/testing only)

---

## UX & Design

- **Layout:** Player card left, opponent card right, stat buttons central (stacked on narrow screens).
- **Color coding:** Player (blue), Opponent (red).
- **Feedback:** Snackbars for prompts (“Choose a stat”), selections (“You picked: Power”), and countdowns.
- **Accessibility:**
  - WCAG ≥ 4.5:1 contrast.
  - Touch targets ≥ 44px.
  - Keyboard-navigable controls and quit confirmation.
  - Stat buttons include `aria-describedby` with short descriptions.
  - Scoreboard regions use `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`.
- **Audio Feedback (Optional, TBD):** Short sound cues for score updates and round outcomes to reinforce feedback.
- **Wireframes:**
  - Card layout with scoreboard at top.
  - Player card (left) and Opponent card (right).
  - Stat buttons centered below player card.
  - Snackbars appear at bottom of screen for prompts and results.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Player can start and finish a match with default settings in ≤ 3 min.
- Stat selection timer behaves correctly: counts down, pauses/resumes, auto-selects if expired.
- Opponent’s stat selection shows after delay with message “Opponent is choosing…”.
- Round outcomes update Scoreboard immediately (Win/Loss/Draw, compared values, updated score).
- Quit flow always confirms before exiting.
- End modal always appears at win target or after 25 rounds, displaying correct results.
- If 25 rounds are reached without a winner, modal must still display correctly.
- All interactive elements meet accessibility standards (labels, focus, ARIA roles).
- Debug/test mode exposes deterministic hooks without affecting normal play.
- **Accessibility-specific:**
  - Given a player uses a screen reader, when a stat button receives focus, then its name and description are read aloud.
  - Given a player uses keyboard only, when tabbing through buttons, then all stat buttons and quit flows are reachable.
  - Given a visually impaired player, when viewing player/opponent cards, then contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 is maintained.

## Edge Cases

- **Dataset load failure:** Error shown with Retry option.
- **Timer drift (> 2 s):** Show “Waiting…” and reset countdown.
- **Simultaneous inputs:** First valid stat input wins; subsequent ignored.
- **AI failure:** Falls back to random stat.
- **Unexpected error:** Roll back to last completed round and show error message.

---

## Constants

- `ROUND_SELECTION_MS = 30_000`
- `MAX_ROUNDS = 25`
- `POINTS_TO_WIN_OPTIONS = [3, 5, 10]`
- `DEFAULT_POINTS_TO_WIN = 5`
- `COOLDOWN_MS = 3_000`

---

## Dependencies

- **Judoka dataset:** `judoka.json` (excluding hidden cards).
- **Shared modules:** Random card draw (`generateRandomCard`), Scoreboard, Snackbar, Modal.
- **Mystery Card:** see [prdMysteryCard.md](prdMysteryCard.md).

---

## Open Questions

1. Should win target choice persist across sessions, or reset each time?
2. Should difficulty setting for AI be exposed to players or reserved for debug/testing?
3. Do we want optional sound effects (e.g., for score updates) in Classic Battle?
