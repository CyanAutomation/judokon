# PRD: Character Design

## TL;DR

This PRD defines the comprehensive design specifications for "KG," the friendly guide character in JU-DO-KON!. KG serves as the game's mascot and helper, providing advice, encouragement, and tips to players aged 8-12. The character follows a chibi (super-deformed) cartoon style with consistent visual identity, expression guidelines, and scene-specific variations. This PRD ensures consistent character representation across all game interfaces, promotional materials, and user interactions.

## Problem Statement

The JU-DO-KON! game requires a consistent, appealing character identity to serve as a guide and mascot for young players. Without standardized character design specifications, different implementations of KG could vary significantly in appearance, personality expression, and visual quality. This inconsistency would confuse players, weaken brand identity, and reduce the character's effectiveness as a friendly guide. Clear design standards are essential for maintaining KG's visual appeal and ensuring consistent user experience across all game contexts.

- **Age Appropriateness**: Ensure character design appeals to target audience of ages 8-12
- **Brand Identity**: Create memorable, distinctive mascot that represents JU-DO-KON! values
- **Emotional Connection**: Design character that feels friendly, approachable, and encouraging
- **Implementation Clarity**: Provide detailed specifications for developers and artists
- **Cultural Authenticity**: Represent Japanese martial arts heritage appropriately and respectfully
