# PRD: Recent Judoka Updates Log

## Description

Players and game developers need a clear, accessible way to view which Judoka cards have been recently updated. This transparency supports testing, game balance awareness, and reduces the need for developers to access system code. For players, this offers visibility into potential balance changes or adjustments to their favorite characters.

A **‚ÄúJudoka Updates‚Äù** button will be added to the main menu. Tapping this takes the player to a standalone web page that displays a summary table of the **20 most recently modified Judoka cards**. This view is dynamically generated from `judoka.json` on each page load. The table uses a simplified format (not full card visuals) for fast loading and easy scanning.

## Goals

- Allow **players and developers** to view the 20 most recently updated Judoka cards.
- Support **quick performance**: Page should load fully in **under 2 seconds** on mid-tier tablets with 2GB RAM over a 3G mobile network.
- Improve visibility into Judoka rebalances without navigating developer tools or card-by-card comparisons.
- Maintain **global UI consistency**: Game header, footer, fonts, and background style.

## Player Flow

1. Player taps **‚ÄúJudoka Updates‚Äù** from the main menu.
2. The page loads the update table showing:
   - Judoka ID
   - Card Code
   - Portrait (thumbnail)
   - Last Modified Date
   - Judoka Name
3. Player can scroll the list (no pagination).
4. Player taps browser/system back to exit the page.

**Cancel/Back:** System back or clicking the game logo in the header returns the player to the home screen.

## Table Behavior & UX Notes

- Table rows appear instantly (no animation) to prioritize performance.
- Portrait thumbnails are 48√ó48 px with rounded corners.
- All cells have a minimum 44px touch target.
- Responsive layout:
  - Two-column stacking below 600px width.
  - Portraits align left, text stacks right.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] List displays exactly 20 entries from `judoka.json`.
- [ ] Entries are sorted by `lastModified` (descending), then `name` (ascending) if dates match.
- [ ] Each row includes: Judoka ID, Card Code, Portrait, Last Modified Date, Judoka Name.
- [ ] Page loads fully in <2s on mid-tier mobile device with 3G connection.
- [ ] Global header and footer are present and match the main game theme.
- [ ] If `judoka.json` is missing or empty, display: ‚ÄúNo Judoka data found.‚Äù
- [ ] If a portrait image is missing, show the default placeholder portrait.
- [ ] Alt text is present for all portraits (e.g., ‚ÄúPortrait of Judoka <Name>‚Äù).
