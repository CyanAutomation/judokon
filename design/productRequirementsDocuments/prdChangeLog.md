# PRD: Recent Judoka Updates Log

## TL;DR

The Recent Judoka Updates Log provides players and developers with a fast, accessible way to view the 20 most recently updated Judoka cards. This feature increases transparency around balance changes and supports both QA and player engagement by surfacing recent modifications directly in the UI. The log is accessible from the Settings menu and displays a responsive, simplified table sourced from `judoka.json`.

---

## Problem Statement / Why It Matters

Players and developers currently lack a simple, in-game method to see which Judoka cards have been updated. This makes it difficult to track balance changes, test recent modifications, or understand why a favorite character may perform differently. Relying on code diffs or external communication is inefficient and excludes non-technical users.

---

## Goals / Success Metrics

- Allow players and developers to view the 20 most recently updated Judoka cards.
- Improve visibility into Judoka rebalances without requiring developer tools or card-by-card comparisons.
- Maintain global UI consistency: header, footer, fonts, and background style.

---

## User Stories

- As a player, I want to see which Judoka cards were recently updated so I can understand balance changes.
- As a developer, I want to quickly verify that recent Judoka edits are reflected in the game UI.
- As a QA tester, I want to confirm that the most recently modified cards are displayed correctly and sorted as expected.

## Prioritized Functional Requirements

| Priority | Feature                  | Description                                                             |
| :------: | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  **P1**  | Load and Parse Data      | Extract Judoka entries from `judoka.json`, including required fields.   |
|  **P1**  | Sort and Display Entries | Sort by `lastUpdated`, fallback to name; limit to 20 results.           |
|  **P2**  | Navigation Integration   | Add ‚ÄúJudoka Updates‚Äù access in the main menu with proper back behavior. |
|  **P2**  | Portrait Display         | Show portrait or fallback image with alt text and size constraints.     |
|  **P2**  | UI Consistency           | Maintain global game layout: header, footer, fonts, and spacing.        |
|  **P3**  | Error/Fallback Handling  | Show user-friendly messages for missing/invalid data or images.         |
|  **P4**  | Accessibility Support    | Support screen-readers and keyboard-only navigation.                    |

## Acceptance Criteria

- The list displays exactly 20 entries from `judoka.json`. (**P1: Sort and Display Entries**)
- Entries are sorted by `lastUpdated` (descending), then `name` (ascending) if dates match. (**P1: Sort and Display Entries**)
- Each row includes: Judoka ID, Portrait, Judoka Name, Card Code, Last Modified Date. (**P1: Load and Parse Data**)
- Global header and footer are present and match the main game theme. (**P2: UI Consistency**)
- If `judoka.json` is missing or empty, display: "No Judoka data found." (**P3: Error/Fallback Handling**)
- If a portrait image is missing, show the default placeholder portrait. (**P2: Portrait Display**)
- Alt text is present for all portraits (e.g., "Portrait of Judoka Kano"). (**P2: Portrait Display**)
- The page is navigable by keyboard and screen-reader compatible. (**P4: Accessibility Support**)
- If loading takes longer than 3 seconds, show a loading spinner; if still no data, show fallback message. (**P3: Error/Fallback Handling**)

---

## Non-Functional Requirements / Design Considerations

- Table rows appear instantly (no animation) to prioritize performance.
- Portrait thumbnails are 48√ó48 px with rounded corners.
- ID column width matches the 48‚ÄØpx portrait column because IDs never exceed three digits.
- All cells have a minimum 44px touch target.
- Responsive layout: two-column stacking below 600px width; portraits align left, text stacks right.
- Row height: min 56px; all touchable areas ‚â•44px.
- Tooltip and alt text for accessibility.
- Maintain consistent header/footer and background style with the main game.

---

## Dependencies and Open Questions

### Dependencies:

- Access to `judoka.json` with up-to-date `lastUpdated` fields.
- Default placeholder portrait asset.
- Game header/footer components.

### Open Questions:

- Should the log include a link to full card details?
- Should the log show more than 20 entries if requested?
- Should we allow filtering or searching within the log?

- Portrait column: **48x48px**, aligned left with margin.
- Row height: **min 56px**; all touchable areas ‚â•44px.
- Mobile layout stacks: Portrait on top, fields below.

## Implementation Notes

- Create `src/helpers/changeLogPage.js` to load `judoka.json` via `fetchJson` and
  populate the table on DOM ready.
- Sort entries by the `lastUpdated` field (desc) and fallback to name when dates
  match. Slice the results to the most recent 20.
- Build rows using DOM methods to avoid innerHTML injection. Each row includes
  Judoka ID, portrait (48√ó48‚ÄØpx), full name, card code, and formatted date.
- Portrait images use a fallback source (`judokaPortrait-0.png`) when loading
  fails, with alt text like "Portrait of Judoka Kano".
- The page follows existing layout conventions: header, `.home-screen` wrapper,
  and bottom navigation bar. Include a spinner during loading and a friendly
  message if no data is available.
- Table rows alternate between `--color-surface` and `--color-tertiary` to
  create zebra striping, starting with `odd` for the first row.
