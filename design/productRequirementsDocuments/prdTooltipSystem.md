# PRD: Tooltip System (JU-DO-KON!)

## TL;DR

The Tooltip System introduces dynamic, in-context guidance across JU-DO-KON! using a flexible JSON-driven approach. By attaching a `data-tooltip-id` attribute to UI elements and rendering markdown-formatted text from a central `tooltips.json` file, the system allows players to receive concise, context-aware explanations during gameplay. This improves accessibility, player comprehension, and overall user experience, especially for younger or first-time users.

---

## Problem Statement / Why It Matters

New or less experienced players may not understand what certain game elements represent — such as unfamiliar stats (e.g. Kumi-kata (grip fighting)), game modes, or buttons — leading to confusion or disengagement. User feedback and playtest sessions have highlighted the need for clear in-context guidance:

> “I didn’t know what Kumi-kata (grip fighting) meant. I just picked the highest number.” — playtester, age 11

Currently, JU-DO-KON! has no way of surfacing explanatory text in the UI without hardcoding strings or duplicating content. This limits future extensibility, localization, and scalability of user help content.

**Why now**: As JU-DO-KON! expands its stat complexity and introduces new game modes, the barrier to entry for new players increases. Immediate in-context help is essential to prevent player drop-off and encourage exploration.

---

## Goals / Success Metrics

- Increase correct stat usage decisions by new players by 20% during their first 3 battles.
- Maintain consistent, scalable tooltips across the app from a single source of truth.
- Enable developers to implement tooltips in any part of the UI with a simple HTML attribute.
- Load and display tooltips in under 150ms on first hover.
- Render basic formatting (bold, italics, line breaks) without manual HTML.

---

## User Stories

- As a new player, I want to understand what a stat like Power or Kumi-kata (grip fighting) means so that I can make better decisions during a battle.
- As a designer, I want to update tooltip text for a stat or UI element in one place so that the change appears everywhere it’s used.
- As a developer, I want a reusable and lightweight tooltip system so that I don’t need to manually write popup logic for each feature.
- As a non-technical content editor, I want to be able to suggest or preview tooltip text without editing core JavaScript code.

| -------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P1**   | tooltips.json store         | Central source for all tooltip content, enabling scalability and updates.         |
| **P1**   | data-tooltip-id hook        | Lightweight implementation hook for developers to add tooltips easily.            |
| **P1**   | Positioning logic           | Ensures tooltips appear correctly and accessibly near elements.                   |
| **P1**   | Markdown-like formatting    | Allows rich text without HTML bloat.                                              |
| **P2**   | Tooltip styling             | Visual consistency with the JU-DO-KON! theme.                                     |
| **P2**   | Auto-hide on mouseout       | Ensures intuitive interaction flow.                                               |
| **P2**   | Touch interaction support   | Tap shows tooltip; second tap outside hides; optional long-press delay on mobile. |

## Acceptance Criteria

- All tooltips appear on hover or focus with no perceptible delay (≤150ms).
- Tooltips display on tap; a second tap outside hides them.
- Tooltip content is loaded from `tooltips.json` and matches the key provided in `data-tooltip-id`.
- Tooltip supports markdown-like formatting: bold, italics, and line breaks.
- Tooltip disappears when mouse leaves the element, focus is lost, or a second tap occurs outside the tooltip.
- Tooltip is styled according to JU-DO-KON! theme and remains readable on all screen sizes.
- Tooltip does not trigger browser-native tooltips (no use of `title` attribute).
- Tooltip is accessible via keyboard and screen reader (ARIA labels, semantic roles), mirroring hover behavior.
- Automated tests verify hover, tap, and keyboard navigation triggers.
- If `tooltips.json` fails to load, tooltips are suppressed and an error is logged once.
- A tooltip can be opened programmatically and suppressed after one dismissal per storage key.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Tooltip rendering must not block game performance; loading/parsing is asynchronous.
- Tooltip text remains readable and does not overlap other content on all supported screen sizes.
- Markdown parsing is lightweight and does not require a full markdown library unless needed.
- Tooltips are compatible with statically hosted environments (e.g. GitHub Pages).
- Tooltips support screen readers and meet accessibility standards (ARIA labels, semantic roles).

### Tooltip Content Guidelines

To ensure tooltips are consistently helpful and aligned with JU-DO-KON!’s tone, the following content standards must be followed when writing or reviewing tooltips:

- **Coverage**: Every interactive UI element that could confuse a new or young player should have a tooltip. Omit tooltips for elements where the function is fully self-explanatory.
  - Stats on cards must provide tooltip descriptions using accessible markdown.
  - Country flag icons require tooltips explaining nationality abbreviations.
  - Weight indicators must include tooltip text clarifying weight classes.
  - Navigation links in the battle screen should expose tooltip guidance.
  - Help icons anywhere in the UI must render tooltip content from `tooltips.json`.
- **Clarity**: Text should be immediately understandable, avoiding jargon. Game-specific terms must be explained using plain language. Aim for a reading level accessible to 10–12-year-olds.
- **Concisiveness**: Tooltips should be succinct – ideally one sentence, or two short ones. Avoid paragraphs or rambling explanations.
- **Tone & Voice**: Tooltips must reflect JU-DO-KON!’s style: casual, instructional, and game-themed. Prefer friendly second-person phrasing ("Tap to...") or descriptive third-person as appropriate.
- **Formatting & Consistency**: Use consistent style:
  - Bold (`**bold**`) key terms or stat names.
  - Italicize (`_italic_`) non-English terms or soft emphasis.
  - Use in-game terminology (e.g. "judoka", not "character").
  - Maintain uniform punctuation and capitalization.
- **Usefulness**: Each tooltip should add context or new information. Do not merely restate the label.
- **Accuracy**: Text must reflect the latest game rules and UI behavior. Outdated or misleading tooltips must be removed or revised.
- **Accessibility**: Tooltips should make sense when read aloud by a screen reader. Avoid directional phrases (“above”, “to the left”) unless paired with structural cues.
- **Uniqueness**: Tooltip content must not duplicate others. Ensure each tooltip serves a distinct explanatory purpose.
- **Review Process**: All new tooltips must pass a readability and tone check, including spelling, grammar, and natural phrasing when read aloud.

### Tooltip Manifest

The Tooltip System owns the canonical manifest for every UI control that requires localized tooltip coverage. Designers and engineers must update this table whenever a control moves, renames, or gains tooltip copy so that downstream tests and fixtures stay aligned.

| Tooltip key         | UI surface                                    | Spec source                                                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `ui.roundMedium`    | Round length selector (10-point medium match) | [`prdGameModes.md`](./prdGameModes.md)                                       |
| `ui.roundLong`      | Round length selector (15-point long match)   | [`prdGameModes.md`](./prdGameModes.md)                                       |

Keep the manifest synchronized with [`tests/fixtures/uiTooltipManifest.js`](../../tests/fixtures/uiTooltipManifest.js) and [`tooltips.json`](../../src/data/tooltips.json) to maintain full coverage validation in [`tests/data/tooltipsEntries.test.js`](../../tests/data/tooltipsEntries.test.js).

## Dependencies and Open Questions

### Dependencies

- Access to `tooltips.json` file within `/data/` or similar directory.
- Basic utility functions for positioning and parsing markdown-like syntax.

### Open Questions

- Should we support richer content in tooltips (e.g. icons, links)?
- Do we want to internationalize `tooltips.json` immediately or defer localization support?
- Should tooltip delays or animations be configurable in settings?
