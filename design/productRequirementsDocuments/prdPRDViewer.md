# PRD: PRD Viewer

## Overview

The PRD Viewer is a browser-based tool that enables JU-DO-KON! contributors and stakeholders to read, browse, and validate Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) directly within the web application. It provides a user-friendly interface for sequentially viewing all PRDs, supporting keyboard and touch navigation, and rendering markdown content as styled HTML.

## Problem Statement

Contributors need a fast, accessible way to review all PRDs without cloning the repository or navigating markdown files manually. Non-technical users may struggle to find and read requirements in raw markdown. A dedicated PRD Viewer ensures everyone can easily access up-to-date requirements and acceptance criteria, improving collaboration and implementation accuracy. Without this tool, delays in implementation and misinterpretation of requirements are more likely.

## Goals

- Enable in-browser reading of all PRDs in the `design/productRequirementsDocuments` directory.
- Support intuitive navigation (buttons, keyboard, swipe) between documents.
- Render markdown PRDs as readable, styled HTML.
- Ensure accessibility and responsive design for all users.
- Achieve markdown rendering performance within 200ms on standard desktop devices.

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to quickly browse all PRDs in sequence so that I can understand feature requirements without searching the repo.
- As a designer, I want to view PRDs with proper formatting and tables so that I can review acceptance criteria and requirements clearly.
- As a product manager, I want to verify that each PRD is present and up-to-date so that I can track project completeness.

## Prioritized Functional Requirements

| Priority | Feature                    | Description                                                      |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P1       | Markdown PRD Loading       | Load all markdown files from the PRD directory and display them. |
| P1       | Markdown-to-HTML Rendering | Convert markdown to styled HTML.                                 |
| P1       | Next/Previous Navigation   | Buttons for navigating PRDs with wrap-around.                    |
| P1       | Keyboard Navigation        | Allow navigation via arrow keys.                                 |
| P1       | Touch/Swipe Navigation     | Support swipe gestures for navigation.                           |
| P2       | Responsive Layout          | Viewer adapts to different device screen sizes.                  |
| P2       | Accessibility              | Fully accessible UI with keyboard/screen reader support.         |
| P3       | Home Link                  | Provide a link to return to the homepage.                        |


## Acceptance Criteria

- All markdown files in `design/productRequirementsDocuments/` are loaded and displayed in the viewer.
- PRDs are rendered as HTML with correct formatting for headings, tables, lists, and code blocks.
- Clicking "Next" or "Prev" navigates to the next or previous PRD, looping at the ends.
- Pressing the right or left arrow key navigates to the next or previous PRD.
- Swiping left or right on touch devices navigates between PRDs.
- The viewer layout adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Navigation buttons are focusable and have accessible labels for screen readers.
- The "Home" link returns the user to the main JU-DO-KON! homepage.
- If a markdown file fails to load, an error is logged to the console and the viewer continues functioning for other files.
- Malformed markdown should render partial content with a warning badge.

## Non-Functional Requirements / Design Considerations

- Rendering should be performant; switching documents should occur within 200ms.
- The viewer must use the site's base styles and support high-contrast mode.
- All navigation controls must be operable via keyboard.
- The viewer must not expose file paths or internal URLs to end users.
- Use interaction feedback like button focus states and smooth transitions.
- Include mockups to visualize layout and flow. (To be attached.)

## Edge Cases / Failure States

- **Markdown File Fails to Load:** Log error, show fallback message, continue displaying others.
- **Malformed Markdown Content:** Display partial content with visual indicator (e.g., warning icon).
- **Slow Network or File Load Delay:** Show loading spinner or status message.
- **Swipe Misfires on Touch Devices:** Implement minimum gesture threshold to avoid accidental navigation.
- **Keyboard Navigation Blocked:** Ensure proper tabindex and role attributes.

## Dependencies and Open Questions

- Depends on the `marked` library for markdown parsing.
- Relies on the file list being up-to-date with all PRDs in the directory.
- Open: Should the viewer support deep-linking to a specific PRD via URL hash or query param?
