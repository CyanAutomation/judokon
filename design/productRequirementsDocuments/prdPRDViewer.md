# PRD: PRD Viewer

## Overview

The PRD Viewer is a browser-based tool that enables JU-DO-KON! contributors and stakeholders to read, browse, and validate Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) directly within the web application. It provides a user-friendly interface for sequentially viewing all PRDs, supporting keyboard and touch navigation, and rendering markdown content as styled HTML.

## Problem Statement

Contributors need a fast, accessible way to review all PRDs without cloning the repository or navigating markdown files manually. Non-technical users may struggle to find and read requirements in raw markdown. A dedicated PRD Viewer ensures everyone can easily access up-to-date requirements and acceptance criteria, improving collaboration and implementation accuracy.

## Goals

- Enable in-browser reading of all PRDs in the `design/productRequirementsDocuments` directory.
- Support intuitive navigation (buttons, keyboard, swipe) between documents.
- Render markdown PRDs as readable, styled HTML.
- Ensure accessibility and responsive design for all users.

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to quickly browse all PRDs in sequence so that I can understand feature requirements without searching the repo.
- As a designer, I want to view PRDs with proper formatting and tables so that I can review acceptance criteria and requirements clearly.
- As a product manager, I want to verify that each PRD is present and up-to-date so that I can track project completeness.

| P1       | Markdown-to-HTML Rendering    | Convert markdown content to styled HTML for display.                                          |
| P1       | Next/Previous Navigation      | Provide buttons to move to the next or previous PRD, with wrap-around at ends.                |
| P1       | Keyboard Navigation           | Allow navigation using left/right arrow keys.                                                 |
| P1       | Touch/Swipe Navigation        | Support swipe gestures on touch devices to change documents.                                  |
| P2       | Responsive Layout             | Ensure the viewer is usable on desktop and mobile devices.                                    |
| P2       | Accessibility                 | Buttons and navigation must be accessible via keyboard and screen readers.                    |
| P3       | Home Link                     | Provide a link back to the main homepage from the viewer.                                     |

## Acceptance Criteria

- All markdown files in `design/productRequirementsDocuments/` are loaded and displayed in the viewer.
- PRDs are rendered as HTML with correct formatting for headings, tables, lists, and code blocks.
- Clicking "Next" or "Prev" navigates to the next or previous PRD, looping at the ends.
- Pressing the right or left arrow key navigates to the next or previous PRD.
- Swiping left or right on touch devices navigates between PRDs.
- The viewer layout adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Navigation buttons are focusable and have accessible labels for screen readers.
- The "Home" link returns the user to the main JU-DO-KON! homepage.
- If a markdown file fails to load, an error is logged and the viewer continues to function for other files.

## Non-Functional Requirements / Design Considerations

- Rendering should be performant; switching documents should occur within 200ms.
- The viewer must use the site's base styles and support high-contrast mode.
- All navigation controls must be operable via keyboard.
- The viewer must not expose file paths or internal URLs to end users.

## Dependencies and Open Questions

- Depends on the `marked` library for markdown parsing.
- Relies on the file list being up-to-date with all PRDs in the directory.
- Open: Should the viewer support deep-linking to a specific PRD via URL hash or query param?
