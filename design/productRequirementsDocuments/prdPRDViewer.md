# PRD: PRD Viewer

## TL;DR

The PRD Viewer is a browser-based tool that enables JU-DO-KON! contributors and stakeholders to read, browse, and validate Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) directly within the web application. It provides a user-friendly interface for sequentially viewing all PRDs with keyboard, touch, and sidebar navigation. A loading spinner and robust error handling keep users informed, and the interface meets accessibility standards with ARIA labels and screen reader support.

---

## Problem Statement

Contributors currently face difficulty reviewing PRDs because they must clone the repository or navigate raw markdown files manually. As one contributor shared:

> "Sometimes I spend more time hunting down the right markdown file than actually understanding the requirements."

Non-technical stakeholders struggle even more with raw markdown formatting, leading to misunderstandings and delayed implementations. A dedicated PRD Viewer tool ensures everyone can easily access up-to-date requirements and acceptance criteria in a readable format, improving collaboration and reducing errors.

---

## Goals

- Enable in-browser reading of all PRDs in the `design/productRequirementsDocuments` directory. **(Implemented)**
- Support intuitive navigation (buttons, keyboard, swipe) between documents.
- Render markdown PRDs as readable, styled HTML with tables, code blocks, and headings. **(Implemented)**
- Ensure accessibility and responsive design for all users. **(Implemented: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader audit completed)**
- Allow deep-linking to a specific PRD via a `?doc=` query parameter and update the URL as navigation occurs. **(Implemented)**

---

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to quickly browse all PRDs in sequence so that I can understand feature requirements without searching the repo.
- As a designer, I want to view PRDs with proper formatting and tables so that I can review acceptance criteria and requirements clearly.
- As a product manager, I want to verify that each PRD is present and up-to-date so that I can track project completeness.
- As any user, I want to easily exit the viewer to the homepage or previous page, so I never feel stuck.

## Defined Player Actions and Game Flow

- The player opens the PRD Viewer from the JU-DO-KON! main menu.
- The viewer loads all markdown files from the `design/productRequirementsDocuments` directory. **(Implemented)**
- A loading spinner appears while fetching documents, hiding once content loads or on fetch error. **(Implemented)**
- The player views the first PRD rendered as styled HTML.
- The player navigates between PRDs by:
  - Selecting a document from the sidebar list,
  - Pressing left/right arrow keys,
  - Swiping left/right on touch devices.
- Navigation loops around at the ends of the PRD list.
- The player can click the JU-DO-KON! logo to exit the viewer at any time.
- If loading a markdown file fails, an error message is shown for that document, and the player can continue navigating others. **(Implemented: Fallback message and error logging)**
- If a markdown file is malformed, partial content is shown with a warning badge. **(Implemented)**
- The viewer is fully keyboard operable, supports screen readers, and adapts layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens. **(Implemented: keyboard navigation, responsive layout, and screen reader support verified)**

## Acceptance Criteria

- Given the PRD Viewer is opened, when loading the markdown files in `design/productRequirementsDocuments/`, then all files are loaded and displayed in sequence. **(Implemented)**
- Given a markdown file is rendered, then headings, tables, lists, and code blocks appear styled as readable HTML. **(Implemented)**
- Given the player presses the right or left arrow keys, then navigation moves accordingly between PRDs. **(Implemented)**
- Given the player selects a document from the sidebar list, then that PRD is displayed in the viewer. **(Implemented)**
- Given the player swipes left or right on a touch device, then the viewer navigates to the next or previous PRD respecting a minimum gesture threshold. **(Implemented)**
- Given the player is on any screen size, then the layout adapts to desktop, tablet, or mobile formats responsively. **(Implemented)**
- Given the player clicks the JU-DO-KON! logo or “Home” link, then the viewer exits to the main homepage. **(Implemented)**
- Given a markdown file fails to load, then an error is logged to the console, a fallback message is shown, and other files remain navigable. **(Implemented)**
- Given malformed markdown content, then partial content is rendered with a warning badge visually indicating an issue. **(Implemented)**
- Given a PRD includes a Tasks section, then the viewer displays the total number of tasks and completion percentage above the document content. **(Implemented)**
- Given the viewer is opened with `?doc=<file>`, then that PRD loads first and the query parameter updates as the user navigates. **(Implemented)**

---

## Non-Functional Requirements / Design Considerations

- The viewer must use the site’s base styles and support high-contrast mode for accessibility. **(Implemented)**
- All navigation controls must be operable via keyboard with clear focus states. **(Implemented; verified with keyboard navigation and screen reader audit)**
- The viewer must not expose internal file paths or repository URLs to end users. **(Implemented)**
- Smooth transitions and interaction feedback (hover and active states, swipe animations) should be implemented. **(Fade-in animation and sidebar hover/active feedback implemented)**
- Minimum tap/click target size of 44x44 pixels for all interactive elements with adequate padding. **(Implemented for sidebar items; full audit pending)**

---

## Edge Cases / Failure States

- **Markdown File Fails to Load:** Log error, show fallback message (“Content unavailable”), continue allowing navigation of others. **(Implemented)**
- **Malformed Markdown Content:** Display partial content with warning icon and accessible tooltip. **(Implemented)**
- **Slow Network or File Load Delay:** Show a loading spinner or status message while fetching files. **(Implemented: spinner shows during load and hides after content renders or on error)**
- **Swipe Misfires on Touch Devices:** Use minimum gesture thresholds and debounce timing to avoid accidental navigations. **(Implemented: 30px threshold)**
- **Keyboard Navigation Blocked:** Ensure `tabindex`, role attributes, and focus management are correctly implemented. **(Partially implemented)**

---

## Dependencies and Open Questions

- Depends on the `markdownToHtml` helper for markdown parsing (uses the `marked` library).
- Requires an up-to-date file list from the `design/productRequirementsDocuments` directory.
- Deep-linking uses the `?doc=` query parameter so URLs can bookmark a specific PRD.

---

## Mockups / Visual Reference

- Header with clickable JU-DO-KON! logo and page title.
- PRD title appears on the left side of the header with a task summary on the right.
- Large scrollable markdown-rendered content area.
- Sidebar scrolls independently from the main preview so the list remains visible while reading.
- Sidebar background uses the `--color-surface` token so zebra stripes stand out.
- Sidebar list items alternate background colors using the `--color-surface` and
  `--color-tertiary` tokens for zebra striping. Odd/even classes start with
  `odd` for the first row.
- Sidebar PRDs are listed alphabetically.
- Warning badge in content area if markdown partially rendered. **(Implemented)**
- Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

**Note:**

- There are no navigation buttons in the UI; navigation is via sidebar, keyboard, or swipe.

### Accessibility Audit Findings

- Screen reader announces the sidebar as "PRD list" and the footer as "Footer navigation".
- Keyboard focus order: logo link → sidebar items → document content → footer links.
- Arrow Up/Down move through the sidebar while keeping focus on the list. Enter or a mouse click moves focus to the document content.
- Left/Right arrow navigation is available when the document content has focus and keeps focus on that region.
- After navigating, focus moves to the document content and the active sidebar item sets `aria-current="page"` for assistive technologies.
- `pa11y` scan of `src/pages/prdViewer.html` reported no accessibility issues.
