# PRD: PRD Viewer

## TL;DR

The PRD Viewer is a browser-based tool that enables JU-DO-KON! contributors and stakeholders to read, browse, and validate Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) directly within the web application. It provides a user-friendly interface for sequentially viewing all PRDs, supporting keyboard and touch navigation, and rendering markdown content as styled HTML.

## Problem Statement

Contributors currently face difficulty reviewing PRDs because they must clone the repository or navigate raw markdown files manually. As one contributor shared:

> "Sometimes I spend more time hunting down the right markdown file than actually understanding the requirements."

Non-technical stakeholders struggle even more with raw markdown formatting, leading to misunderstandings and delayed implementations. A dedicated PRD Viewer tool ensures everyone can easily access up-to-date requirements and acceptance criteria in a readable format, improving collaboration and reducing errors.

## Goals

- Enable in-browser reading of all PRDs in the `design/productRequirementsDocuments` directory.
- Support intuitive navigation (buttons, keyboard, swipe) between documents.
- Render markdown PRDs as readable, styled HTML with tables, code blocks, and headings.
- Ensure accessibility and responsive design for all users.
- Achieve markdown rendering performance with document switches completing within 200ms on standard desktop devices.

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to quickly browse all PRDs in sequence so that I can understand feature requirements without searching the repo.
- As a designer, I want to view PRDs with proper formatting and tables so that I can review acceptance criteria and requirements clearly.
- As a product manager, I want to verify that each PRD is present and up-to-date so that I can track project completeness.
- As any user, I want to easily exit the viewer to the homepage or previous page, so I never feel stuck.

## Defined Player Actions and Game Flow

- The player opens the PRD Viewer from the JU-DO-KON! main menu.
- The viewer loads all markdown files from the `design/productRequirementsDocuments` directory.
- The player views the first PRD rendered as styled HTML.
- The player navigates between PRDs by:
  - Clicking “Next” or “Previous” buttons,
  - Pressing left/right arrow keys,
  - Swiping left/right on touch devices.
- Navigation loops around at the ends of the PRD list.
- The player can click the JU-DO-KON! logo or a dedicated “Home” link to exit the viewer at any time.
- If loading a markdown file fails, an error message is shown for that document, and the player can continue navigating others.
- If a markdown file is malformed, partial content is shown with a warning badge.
- The viewer is fully keyboard operable, supports screen readers, and adapts layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

## Prioritized Functional Requirements

| Priority | Feature                    | Description                                                          |
| -------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P1       | Markdown PRD Loading       | Load all markdown files from the PRD directory and display them.     |
| P1       | Markdown-to-HTML Rendering | Convert markdown to styled HTML with accurate formatting.            |
| P1       | Next/Previous Navigation   | Buttons for navigating PRDs with wrap-around at ends.                |
| P1       | Keyboard Navigation        | Allow navigation via arrow keys with focus management.               |
| P1       | Touch/Swipe Navigation     | Support swipe gestures with gesture threshold to avoid misfires.     |
| P2       | Responsive Layout          | Viewer adapts seamlessly to different device screen sizes.           |
| P2       | Accessibility              | Fully accessible UI including ARIA labels and screen reader support. |
| P3       | Home Link                  | Provide a prominent link to return to the homepage.                  |

## Acceptance Criteria

- Given the PRD Viewer is opened, when loading the markdown files in `design/productRequirementsDocuments/`, then all files are loaded and displayed in sequence.
- Given a markdown file is rendered, then headings, tables, lists, and code blocks appear styled as readable HTML.
- Given the player clicks “Next” or “Prev” buttons, then navigation moves to the next/previous PRD, looping from last to first or vice versa.
- Given the player presses the right or left arrow keys, then navigation moves accordingly between PRDs.
- Given the player swipes left or right on a touch device, then the viewer navigates to the next or previous PRD respecting a minimum gesture threshold.
- Given the player is on any screen size, then the layout adapts to desktop, tablet, or mobile formats responsively.
- Given the navigation buttons are rendered, then they are keyboard focusable with ARIA labels and visible focus outlines.
- Given the player clicks the JU-DO-KON! logo or “Home” link, then the viewer exits to the main homepage.
- Given a markdown file fails to load, then an error is logged to the console, a fallback message is shown, and other files remain navigable.
- Given malformed markdown content, then partial content is rendered with a warning badge visually indicating an issue.
- Given navigation occurs, then the document renders within 200ms on a standard desktop device.

## Non-Functional Requirements / Design Considerations

- The viewer must use the site’s base styles and support high-contrast mode for accessibility.
- All navigation controls must be operable via keyboard with clear focus states.
- The viewer must not expose internal file paths or repository URLs to end users.
- Smooth transitions and interaction feedback (button press states, swipe animations) should be implemented.
- Minimum tap/click target size of 44x44 pixels for all interactive elements.
- Provide wireframes and mockups to visualize layout, navigation flow, and error states. (See attached visual reference.)

## Edge Cases / Failure States

- **Markdown File Fails to Load:** Log error, show fallback message (“Content unavailable”), continue allowing navigation of others.
- **Malformed Markdown Content:** Display partial content with warning icon and accessible tooltip.
- **Slow Network or File Load Delay:** Show a loading spinner or status message while fetching files.
- **Swipe Misfires on Touch Devices:** Use minimum gesture thresholds and debounce timing to avoid accidental navigations.
- **Keyboard Navigation Blocked:** Ensure `tabindex`, role attributes, and focus management are correctly implemented.

## Dependencies and Open Questions

- Depends on the `markdownToHtml` helper for markdown parsing (uses the `marked` library).
- Requires an up-to-date file list from the `design/productRequirementsDocuments` directory.
- **Open:** Should the viewer support deep-linking to specific PRDs via URL hash or query parameters? This affects navigation and state restoration.

## Mockups / Visual Reference

- Header with clickable JU-DO-KON! logo (links Home), page title, and Prev/Next navigation buttons.
- Large scrollable markdown-rendered content area.
- Warning badge in content area if markdown partially rendered.
- Bottom footer with keyboard and swipe navigation instructions.
- Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
