# PRD: Country Flag Picker Filter

---

## TL;DR

This PRD defines a Country Flag Picker Filter for Ju-Do-Kon! that lets players filter Judoka cards by country using an intuitive, accessible flag selector. The goal is to improve user engagement by enabling fast, pride-driven exploration of favorite countries’ athletes, with a performant, responsive, and accessible UI. The picker integrates directly with the Browse Judoka screen and card carousel, supporting both mouse/touch and keyboard navigation.

> Jamal logs into Ju-Do-Kon! after seeing a clip of his country’s top Judoka. He taps the country picker, slides open the panel, and spots his flag among dozens. One tap later, the screen fills with fierce fighters from his homeland. He feels proud — and motivated to start collecting more.

## Problem Statement

Each judoka and judoka card is affiliated with a country (e.g., a judoka might be part of the Spanish team). Currently, there is no way for players to browse judoka by country, which frustrates players when searching for their favorite country’s athletes. The lack of an intuitive country filter diminishes user experience, leading to inefficient browsing and potential drop-off.

> By including a country picker, we aim to increase session duration and card interaction rates — both critical, as longer, more engaged sessions correlate directly with higher player retention and in-game activity.

This issue is timely as our player base is expanding internationally, and regional pride in athletes is becoming a key driver of engagement.

## Goals

- **Performance Goal**: Enable country filtering happens quickly for 90% of sessions.
- **Reliability Goal**: Achieve zero crashes related to the country selector over 100 sessions.
- **Coverage Goal**: Ensure >90% of available countries are selectable via the flag interface.
- **UX Goal**: Achieve a >95% success rate where users select the intended country without mis-taps.
- Let players easily find Judoka from their favorite countries.
- Provide a visually engaging, pride-driven exploration of the card roster.
- Ensure full accessibility compliance (see Accessibility section).

---

## Non-Goals

- Does not cover creation of new flag assets outside the existing judoka roster.
- Omits multi-country selection to keep interactions simple.

---

## User Stories

- As a player who supports my national team, I want to quickly filter Judoka by my country so I can see my favorite athletes **(results ≤1 s)**.
- As a mobile player, I want country flags large enough to tap accurately so I don’t get frustrated with mistaps.
- As a player with limited vision, I want alt-text and good contrast on flags so I can recognize countries clearly.
- As a keyboard-only user, I want to navigate the country picker and select flags using the keyboard.

---

## How It Works

On in-scope screens (e.g., the Browse Judoka screen), there should be an option to toggle an overlay or slide-in panel that presents all available countries.

**Key Details:**

- Only countries present in the `judoka.json` file will be displayed.
- Instead of a list, the selector will use flag icons to represent each country.
- When a user clicks or presses Enter/Space on a flag:
  - The card carousel refreshes, filtering to display only judoka from the selected country (e.g., clicking Jamaica will filter to only Jamaican judoka).
- Users can only select one country at a time.
- A clear filter icon is provided to reset the selection and revert to displaying all judoka.
- Default display mode when opened is **slide-in panel**.
- The toggle is represented by a panel icon with an arrow.
- A separate layout toggle switches between the slide-in panel and full-screen grid.
- Countries are displayed in alphabetical order.
- Each flag button includes alt-text and an `aria-label` (e.g., "Filter by {country}") for accessibility.
- The picker supports keyboard navigation: Tab/Shift+Tab to move between flags, Enter/Space to select, and Escape to close the panel.
- The panel appears below the persistent top bar so the first row of countries is fully visible.
- If no judoka exist for a selected country, an empty state message is shown ("No judoka available for this country").
- If a flag asset fails to load, a generic fallback flag icon is displayed.
- For collections larger than 50 countries, virtual scrolling or paging is implemented to prevent UI overload.
- Progressive flag loading is used on slow networks to prioritize interactivity.

### Flow

1. Player opens the Browse Judoka screen and taps the country selector toggle.
2. The slide-in panel opens in under one second.
3. Players may use the layout toggle to expand to a full-screen grid or return to the slide-in panel.
4. Tapping or pressing Enter/Space on a flag filters the carousel and highlights the selected country.
5. The clear filter icon resets the view and the player continues browsing or closes the selector.
6. Keyboard users can navigate flags and close the panel with Escape.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Interaction

- On screens where multiple cards are shown, users are presented with the country selector toggle.
- Clicking or pressing Enter/Space on a country flag:
  - Filters the card carousel to only show cards from that country.
  - The selected country flag is visually highlighted.
- A clear filter icon resets the card carousel to show all cards.
- Keyboard navigation is supported for all flag buttons and the clear filter icon.
- The panel can be closed with Escape.

### Performance

- The filtering operation completes quickly.
- The selector appears quickly when toggled open.
- The country selector must:
  - Support at least 100 countries without exceeding additional load time.

### Accessibility

- Provide alt-text for all country flags.
- Each flag button has an `aria-label` (e.g., "Filter by {country}").
- Country flags must be displayed in alphabetical order.
- Provide clear feedback if no judoka exist for a selected country (empty state messaging).
- Handle missing flag assets gracefully with a fallback icon.
- Tap target size must be at least 44x44px (see [UI Design Standards](../codeStandards/codeUIDesignStandards.md#9-accessibility--responsiveness)).
- Color contrast ratios must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- Keyboard navigation and focus outlines are visible and accessible.

---

## Edge Cases and Failure States

- If no judoka exist for a selected country, show an empty state message (“No judoka available for this country”).
- If a flag asset fails to load, display a generic fallback flag icon.
- For collections larger than 50 countries, implement virtual scrolling or paging to prevent UI overload.
- On slow networks, implement graceful degradation with progressive flag loading to prioritize interactivity.
- If the country list is empty, display a message: "No countries available."

---

## Technical Considerations

- Pull available countries dynamically from `judoka.json` to avoid hardcoding.
- Use image sprite sheets or CDN hosting for flag assets to reduce HTTP requests.
- Use `IntersectionObserver` with `loading="lazy"` to defer flag image requests until they enter the viewport.
- Detect network conditions via `navigator.connection` to reduce initial batch sizes on slow connections.
- Fallback flag asset should be a small, lightweight SVG or PNG.
- Ensure caching headers on flags to minimize repeat loads.
- Integrate with the card carousel to trigger filtering and update the visible cards.
- Ensure the panel appears below the persistent top bar and is responsive to different screen sizes.
- Keyboard navigation and focus management must be implemented for all interactive elements.

---

## Dependencies and Integrations

- `judoka.json` data file for country information.
- Card carousel component which displays filtered judoka cards.
- Integrated with the Browse Judoka screen (see [PRD: Browse Judoka](prdBrowseJudoka.md)).

---

## Open Questions

- **Pending:** Decide whether to add text search for countries in addition to flag selection.
- **Pending:** Determine if analytics are needed for every country selection.

---

## Design and UX Considerations

- Background of the country selector uses `var(--color-secondary)` so flags and text meet the required 4.5:1 contrast ratio.
- Each country is represented by:
  - Flag icon.
  - Country name label beneath the flag.
- Three display modes:
  - Hidden: No UI visible until toggled.
  - Slide-in Panel (default): Narrow vertical panel with scroll.
  - Full-Screen Grid: Grid layout showing all countries.
- A layout toggle control switches between the slide-in panel and full-screen grid.
- Mobile Optimization:
  - Minimum tap target size of 44x44px for flags to ensure touch accessibility (see [UI Design Standards](../codeStandards/codeUIDesignStandards.md#9-accessibility--responsiveness)).
  - Color contrast ratios must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for readability.
  - Selected country should be visually highlighted (e.g., border or shading).
  - Selector should respond well to different screen sizes (responsive design).
  - The panel must appear below the persistent top bar so the first row of countries is fully visible.
- Animation Considerations:
  - Slide-in animation respects the user's `prefers-reduced-motion` setting.
  - Flag grid fade-in duration uses `var(--transition-fast)`.
- Keyboard navigation:
  - Tab/Shift+Tab to move between flags and clear filter icon.
  - Enter/Space to select a flag or clear filter.
  - Escape to close the panel.
  - Focus outlines are visible and accessible.
