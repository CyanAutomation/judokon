Product Requirements Document – Function to Draw Random Card

⸻

Problem Statement

As part of a web browser-based game, there are points where users need to draw a random card. This mechanic adds vital excitement and unpredictability, as players don’t know what card will come next. The uncertainty enhances one-on-one battles, making matches feel dynamic and engaging. Without this feature, gameplay would require pre-selecting cards, resulting in a less dynamic and less exciting experience.

This function is critical to:
	•	Enhancing pacing — maintaining game flow without pauses for manual selection.
	•	Increasing replayability — promoting different outcomes on each playthrough.
	•	Boosting session duration and engagement — we expect session duration to increase by at least 10% due to the added tension and dynamism this mechanic brings.

How It Works
	•	The user will hit a button or navigate to a certain page.
	•	This action will auto-trigger the generateRandomCard() function.
	•	The code logic will:
	•	Select a random Judoka card from the active card set.
	•	Render the selected card visually using JavaScript.
	•	Include a fade or bounce animation on card reveal, accompanied by a sound effect.
	•	Ensure animation smoothness at ≥60fps for a seamless experience on devices with ≥2GB RAM.

Definition:
	•	Active card set: The current pool of available cards in the player’s deck, dynamically updated based on game state.

Edge Cases / Failure States
	•	Same Card Reselection: Possible and expected; randomness allows duplicates.
	•	Random Pick Failure: If the random draw fails (e.g., code error), display a predefined fallback card with a clear error notification.
	•	Empty Card Set: Display an error card if no cards are available in the active set.
	•	Low Performance Devices: Ensure minimal animation; fallback to static reveal if animation stutters detected.
	•	Accessibility (Reduced Motion Settings): Respect system settings for reduced motion by disabling animations if enabled.

Goals

Goal	Metric
Fast Response	Card draw completes in under 300ms.
Smooth Animation	Animation plays at ≥60fps, with no visual glitches.
Fair Randomness	Random selection passes chi-square testing for uniformity, 95% confidence over 100 draws.
Low Failure Rate	No more than 1% draw failures.
Accessibility	Animation disabled automatically if system Reduced Motion setting is on.

Acceptance Criteria
	•	When “Draw Card” is triggered, a random card from the active set is displayed within 300ms.
	•	Reveal animation (fade or bounce) completes within 500ms, maintaining ≥60fps on mid-tier devices.
	•	If the random function fails, a fallback card is shown and an error message is presented.
	•	The random distribution passes chi-square testing with 95% confidence over 100 draws.
	•	If the active card set is empty, an error card is shown.
	•	Animation is disabled if the user has enabled Reduced Motion preferences.

| P1      | Display Selected Card       | Visually display the drawn card with fade or bounce animation and sound.|
| P2      | Fallback on Failure         | Display a fallback card and error message if draw fails.                |
| P2      | Reusable Random Draw Module | Make the random draw function callable from various screens.            |
| P3      | Accessibility Support       | Provide reduced-motion support for users preferring less animation.     |
| P3      | UX Enhancements             | Ensure 60fps animation smoothness and add sound effects on card reveal.  |

Design and User Experience Considerations
	•	Animation Style: Fade or bounce — no flip to keep transitions simple and polished.
	•	Sound Effect: A short celebratory chime or swoosh when card appears.
	•	Responsiveness: Ensure smooth transitions on devices with ≥2GB RAM; degrade gracefully on weaker devices.
	•	Accessibility:
	•	Respect Reduced Motion settings.
	•	Ensure color contrast and text readability on cards.
	•	Fallback Visuals:
	•	If card loading fails, show a placeholder or error graphic.
