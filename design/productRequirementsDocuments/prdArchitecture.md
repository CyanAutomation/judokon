# Architecture PRD

## TL;DR

This PRD captures the authoritative architecture decisions and component contracts for JU-DO-KON!. It defines system boundaries, responsibilities, and stable public contracts used by other PRDs, tests, and integrations.

## Problem Statement / Why it matters

Architecture decisions are cross-cutting and affect multiple teams and features. Without a single source of truth, components drift, tests break, and integrations become brittle. This PRD centralizes those decisions so that changes are deliberate and traceable.

## Goals / Success Metrics

- Provide a concise map of core components and responsibilities.
- Define public contracts (APIs, events, data shapes) that are stable and versioned.
- Reduce integration regressions by 90% (measured by integration test failures tied to interface changes).

## Component Responsibilities

- Battle Engine (`src/helpers/BattleEngine.js` and `src/helpers/battleEngineFacade.js`): authoritative game logic (draws, scoring, resolution). Emits canonical events used by UI and tests.
- Classic Battle UI (`src/pages/battleJudoka.html`, `src/helpers/classicBattle.js`): rendering, stat buttons, timers; consumes Battle Engine events and emits UI events.
- CLI (`src/pages/battleCLI.html`): text-mode presentation layered above the same engine and state machine.
- Data Layer (`src/data/*`): static assets (judoka.json, card data) and any canonical schema artifacts.
- RAG/Vector Search (`src/helpers/vectorSearch` / `minilm` models): search and query expansion responsibilities.
- Test Orchestration / Fixtures (`playwright/`, `tests/`): helpers and promises used to detect engine/UI readiness.

## Public Contracts Inventory (starter)

This PRD must be populated and maintained with a canonical inventory. The table below is a starter subset; owners must keep it current.

Events:

- `battle:round-start` — emitter: Battle Engine; payload: `{ roundNumber: number, playerIds: [string, string] }` — consumers: UI, CLI, tests — owner: Battle Engine.
- `battle:stat-selected` — emitter: UI/CLI; payload: `{ playerId: string, statKey: string, timestamp: string }` — consumers: Engine, tests — owner: Classic Battle UI.
- `battle:round-resolved` — emitter: Battle Engine; payload: `{ winnerId?: string, tie: boolean, details: object }` — consumers: UI, scoreboard — owner: Battle Engine.

DOM IDs / Data Attributes (see `prdBattleMarkup.md` for the full list):

- `#round-message`, `#snackbar-container`, `#battle-state-badge`, `data-stat-key`, and recommended `data-test-id` attributes.

Data Schemas:

- `judoka` (see `prdDataSchemas.md`), `card`, `navigationMap`.

## Hot-path Import Policy

Hot-path modules (those executed in timing-sensitive loops, selection handlers, or render hot paths) MUST use static imports. Dynamic imports (`await import(...)`) are allowed only for optional, heavy, or feature-flag guarded modules and must be preloaded during idle time.

Starter hot-path list (owners must keep this list current):

- `src/helpers/classicBattle.js` (selection handling, timers)
- `src/helpers/battleEngineFacade.js`
- `src/helpers/BattleEngine.js`
- `src/helpers/showSnackbar.js` (if used in round flow)

Change to any hot-path module that introduces dynamic imports requires Architecture PRD sign-off and regression tests demonstrating no measurable impact on selection latency.

## Versioning and Change Process

Public contract changes MUST follow this minimal process:

1. Update relevant PRD with rationale and migration plan.

2. Create implementation PR referencing the PRD and include unit + integration tests proving compatibility or demonstrating migration.

3. Allow a one-week deprecation window for non-breaking changes; for breaking changes, publish a migration guide and increment the contract major version.

Versioning recommendation: use `major.minor` for contracts (e.g., event v1 → v2). When publishing an incompatible change, increment major and provide a compatibility bridge when feasible (e.g., emit both v1 and v2 events for a transition period).

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Summary

| Area                   | Target                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Determinism (testMode) | Engine decisions reproducible with seeded RNG                                 |
| Selection latency      | UI selection handlers respond within 16ms JS main-thread budget (no blocking) |
| Vector search          | Local dev response <250ms; production targets differ by infra                 |
| Accessibility          | Keyboard navigation for primary flows, ARIA labels for key controls           |

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to know which module owns the battle state so I can make safe changes.
- As a tester, I want stable event names and DOM contracts so Playwright tests are reliable.

## Prioritized Functional Requirements

P1 - Component Boundary Diagram: Provide a high-level diagram listing components and responsibilities (Battle Engine, UI, RAG/VectorSearch, CLI, Data Layer).

Acceptance Criteria:

- A named diagram file exists and is referenced by this PRD.

P1 - Public Contracts Inventory: A list of public APIs, events, DOM IDs, and stable data shapes with owner and versioning policy.

Acceptance Criteria:

- Each entry lists owner module, schema/location, and change process.

P2 - Hot-path Import Policy: Document which modules must use static imports (hot paths) and which may use dynamic imports with preload.

Acceptance Criteria:

- Static/dynamic import guidance is present and references `src/helpers/classicBattle.js` and related hot-path files.

P2 - Non-functional requirements summary: Latency, determinism, and observability constraints for cross-cutting components.

Acceptance Criteria:

- A short NFR table with measurable targets exists.

## Non-Functional Requirements / Design Considerations

- Determinism: Battle engine decisions must be reproducible in test mode.
- Latency: Vector search responses should be < 250ms in local development (where applicable).
- Observability: Key actions should emit events for tracing and testing.

## Dependencies and Open Questions

- Depends on `prdBattleEngine.md` for engine internals.
- Open question: Versioning scheme for events and DOM contracts (major.minor?), propose v1 semantics.

## Appendix / Next actions

- Action: Owners of Battle Engine, Classic Battle UI, and Vector Search should populate the canonical inventory section in this PRD with full contract entries and reference schemas/diagrams.

## Appendix / Sources

- See `design/architecture.md`, `design/eventNamingAudit.md`, and `design/productRequirementsDocuments/prdStateHandler.md` for background.

### Appendix: Project Architecture Overview (assimilated from `design/architecture.md`)

This appendix preserves the implementation and agent-facing notes from the former `design/architecture.md`.

#### Entry Points

- `game.js` — exports setup helpers and `initGame`. `gameBootstrap.js` listens for `DOMContentLoaded` and invokes `initGame` in production.

#### helpers/

Reusable utilities organized by concern (card building, data fetching, random card generation). Prefer small, single-purpose functions. Key helpers: `generateRandomCard()`, `renderJudokaCard()`, `navigationBar.js`, `setupBottomNavbar.js`.

Engine vs UI layers: Core battle logic lives in `helpers/battleEngine.js` with no DOM access. UI scripts call the engine via the facade in `helpers/api/battleUI.js`.

#### helpers/vector search

Vector-search pages import DOM-free utilities from `helpers/api/vectorSearchPage.js` for match selection, tag formatting, and MiniLM extractor loading.

#### Data

- `judoka.json`, `tooltips.json`, `cards.json` — canonical static JSON sources.

#### AI Agent Design Considerations

- State exposure via `data-*` attributes, toggleable debug panels, stable ID/class naming, modular JS/HTML, and observable hashes/query params.

#### Event Bus & State Manager

- The Classic Battle orchestrator emits `battleStateChange` events; `document.body.dataset.battleState` mirrors the current state.
- State progression: `waitingForMatchStart` → `matchStart` → `cooldown` → ... → `matchOver`.

See the original `design/architecture.md` for annotated components and agent-facing tables; content has been integrated into this PRD to centralize architecture guidance.
