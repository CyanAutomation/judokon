# PRD: Browse Judoka

---

**Game Mode ID:** `7` (URL: browseJudoka.html)

Browse Judoka is accessible from the Main Page ([prdHomePageNavigation.md](prdHomePageNavigation.md)), Navigation Bar ([prdNavigationBar.md](prdNavigationBar.md)), or Navigation Map ([prdNavigationMap.md](prdNavigationMap.md)) and opens a full-screen roster view. Players first see a country filter panel alongside a card carousel.

The carousel relies on the `buildCardCarousel` helper ([prdCardCarousel.md](prdCardCarousel.md)) and filtering uses the Country Flag Picker ([prdCountryPickerFilter.md](prdCountryPickerFilter.md)).

---

## TL;DR

Browse Judoka includes a scrollable, responsive carousel that allows players to view every available judoka card, fostering exploration, strategic team building, and a sense of ownership. This PRD defines how to implement a performant, accessible browsing experience across mobile and desktop.

> Kai hears that a new rare judoka has been added to the game, and excitedly visits the Browse Judoka screen. Swiping through the collection, he sees cards elegantly snap into place. The center card zooms slightly as it comes into focus, making it feel like a physical binder. He starts planning his next team with ease, deepening his connection to the judoka roster.

---

## Problem Statement

Players currently lack a centralized way to view all available judoka, making roster exploration cumbersome — leading to frustration and disengagement.

> _“I want to see all judoka in one place so I don’t waste time hunting for cards.”_ — Player feedback

This problem is especially pressing now as the roster grows, and players want a quick way to plan their team or see which cards are available in the game.

---

## Goals

- Allow players to explore the entire roster in one place.
- Encourage discovery of new judoka to build creative teams.
- Support smooth browsing on devices.
- Increase attachment to favorite fighters through easy access.
- Keep players engaged by making team planning enjoyable.

---

## Non-Goals

- No advanced sorting or search features in this version.
- No judoka editing or management from the browse screen.
- No card acquisition or unlock actions from this view.

---

## User Stories

- As a player interested in building my team, I want to browse all judoka cards quickly so I can plan my roster effectively (**view 10 cards in ≤10 s**).
- As a mobile player, I want the roster to display correctly on my phone so I can explore judoka anywhere.
- As a keyboard-only user, I want to navigate the listed cards using arrow keys so I can browse without a mouse.
- As a visually impaired player, I want focus highlights and alt text so I can browse judoka using assistive technologies.
- As a collector, I want smooth, satisfying animations when scrolling, so I feel excited about exploring my roster.
- As a fan of my national team, I want to filter judoka by country so I can focus on athletes from my homeland.

| **P1**   | Stats Data Binding              | Pull stats from `judoka.json` for accurate card display. |
| **P1**   | Responsive Layout               | Adapt card layout across devices (mobile & desktop). |
| **P2**   | Placeholder for Invalid Entries | Show default card if an entry is missing or invalid. |
| **P2**   | Carousel Display of Cards       | Present cards in a swipe/scroll carousel with large "Previous" and "Next" arrow buttons for efficient browsing. (See [PRD: Judoka Card Carousel](prdCardCarousel.md) for carousel requirements.) |
| **P2**   | Hover/Keyboard Navigation       | Support interactions for accessibility. |
| **P2**   | Country Filter Disclosure       | Use native `<details>`/`<summary>` semantics for the country filter accordion to gain built-in focus management, keyboard toggling (Enter/Space), and announced state changes for screen readers. |
| **P3**   | Page Markers                    | Show "current page of total" below the carousel with the active page highlighted. |

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- If the judoka list is empty, display a message saying “No cards available.”
- The full list of up to 100 judoka cards loads and is visible quickly.
- On mobile (320px–600px), 1–2 cards are visible at once; on desktop (>600px), 3–5 cards are visible, and layout adapts fluidly on window resize.
- If `judoka.json` contains an invalid or missing card entry, show a default placeholder card instead.
- Scrolling rapidly through the card carousel remains smooth.
- If the network fails to load `judoka.json`, display an error message: “Unable to load roster” and provide a button to retry.
- Using keyboard arrow keys (left/right) moves focus to the previous/next card, and the focused card is visually highlighted and enlarged.
- The Country Flag Picker panel appears below the top bar, is accessible via keyboard and screen reader, and supports closing with Escape.
- Country flags are displayed alphabetically, with alt-text and aria-labels for accessibility.
- If no judoka exist for a selected country, display “No judoka available for this country.”
- If a flag asset fails to load, display a fallback flag icon.
- The clear filter icon resets the filter to show all judoka.
- The country picker supports minimum tap target size (44x44px) and color contrast per WCAG 2.1 AA.
- Keyboard navigation and focus outlines are visible for all picker elements.

---

## Edge Cases / Failure States

- If `judoka.json` fails to load, display an error message: “Unable to load roster.”
- If a card image fails, show the default judoka card (judoka id=0).
- On network interruption during data fetch, prompt the user to retry.

---

## Design and UX Considerations

See [PRD: Judoka Card Carousel](prdCardCarousel.md) for carousel-specific animations, responsiveness, and mockups.

- The Country Flag Picker panel appears below the persistent top bar and stacks above the carousel on screens below 768px.
- Picker supports keyboard navigation (Tab/Shift+Tab, Enter/Space, Escape) and screen reader accessibility.
- The picker toggle uses a native `<details>/<summary>` disclosure so semantics, focus management, and keyboard shortcuts follow platform expectations while keeping the custom styling.
- Picker displays only countries present in `judoka.json`. Countries are sorted alphabetically using `localeCompare`, and each flag image includes alt text and an `aria-label` based on the country name.
- Picker provides a clear filter icon to reset selection.
- If no judoka exist for a selected country, an empty state message is shown.
- If a flag asset fails to load, the picker swaps it for a generic fallback flag icon while keeping the accessible label.
- Picker is responsive and touch targets are ≥44px.
- Country filter accordion uses native `<details>` and `<summary>` so disclosure state, focus order, and keyboard toggling follow built-in browser semantics, providing automatic ARIA state management and screen reader announcements.
- Judoka cards must display all stats without scrolling on common desktop resolutions (e.g., 1440px width).

Country list generation uses `localeCompare` for alphabetical sorting, applies the country name as both alt text and `aria-label`, and falls back to a generic icon if a flag image fails to load.

### QA Notes

- Rely on the browser’s default focus outline, `summary` activation, and `details[open]` state styling when testing the country filter accordion—custom hover/keyboard affordances are intentionally minimal because native semantics already cover them.
- Verify that the disclosure state persists appropriately during filtering operations and that the `details[open]` attribute correctly reflects the visual state.

## User Flow: Browse Judoka

**Entry**

- Player selects “Browse Judoka” from the main menu, navigation map or bottom navigation bar.
- System loads `judoka.json` data asynchronously.
- If loading fails, show error message with “Retry” button.
- If list empty, show “No cards available” message.

**Browsing**

- Cards display in a horizontal carousel.
- On mobile: 1–2 cards visible; on desktop: 3–5 cards visible.
- Player can scroll/swipe cards horizontally.
- Smooth snapping behavior to center cards on scroll end.
- Center card is visually enlarged (~10%) for focus.
- Scroll markers update to reflect current carousel position.

**Navigation**

- Player can navigate cards by:
  - Touch/swipe on mobile.
  - Mouse hover (enlarges card).
  - Keyboard arrow keys (left/right) move focus and enlarge card.
- Focused card is highlighted visually for accessibility.

**Error Handling**

- If a card image fails, show the default judoka card (judoka id=0).
- On network issues during loading, prompt with retry.

---

## Technical Considerations

- Built on `src/pages/browseJudoka.html` to load data.
- Uses `src/helpers/carouselBuilder.js` via `buildCardCarousel`.
- Integrates the Country Flag Picker for filtering.

**Wireframe Annotations:**

- Carousel: Horizontally scrollable row of cards with large "Previous" and "Next" arrow buttons on desktop; players can also swipe or scroll on mobile.
- Cards: Each card displays judoka stats; center card is enlarged by ~10%.
- Page Markers: Display "current page of total" below the carousel with the active page highlighted; updates are announced via `aria-live` for screen readers.
- Messages: Area below markers for dynamic feedback such as “No cards available” or error messages.
- Touch Targets: Cards and buttons sized ≥44px for accessibility compliance. See [UI Design Standards](../codeStandards/codeUIDesignStandards.md#9-accessibility--responsiveness) for full guidelines.
- Responsive Adaptation: On mobile, 1–2 cards visible; on desktop, 3–5 cards visible.
- On screens below 768px the filter bar stacks above the carousel to avoid card shrinkage.
