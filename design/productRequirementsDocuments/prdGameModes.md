# Ju-Do-Kon! Game Modes – Product Requirements Document

## Overview

**Ju-Do-Kon!** offers a range of game modes tailored for different play styles—competitive battles, team-based challenges, creative customization, exploratory discovery and quiet reflection. These modes diversify the experience, increase replayability and promote deeper engagement.

> After a tough **Classic Battle**, Hiroshi takes a break by entering **Meditation** Mode. Soft music and inspiring quotes help him reconnect with why he loves judo. Later, he updates his Judoka’s signature move, making his fighter truly his own. By offering more than just battles, Ju-Do-Kon! becomes a game players want to return to every day—whether they crave intense combat or quiet reflection.

### Problem Statement

Returning players often exit after short sessions due to repetitive gameplay loops and limited creative expression.

#### User Stories

- As a player who’s tired of pure competition, I want a Meditation mode so I can relax and still feel connected to the game.
- As a player with a favorite judoka, I want to update their stats and appearance so they grow with me.

### Why It Matters Now

Improving session variety directly supports retention and encourages more personalized play, especially as competition from other collectible games increases.

### Goals

**KPI Targets**

- Increase returning player average session length by **20%**.
- At least **80%** of users who begin a Team Battle complete the match.
- **70%** of new players use Judoka Creation within their first week.
- **60%** of all players trigger Meditation mode at least once weekly.

**Player Experience Goals** _(qualitative)_

- Players experience diverse ways to interact with their judoka.
- Players find modes matching their mood: competitive, creative, or relaxing.
