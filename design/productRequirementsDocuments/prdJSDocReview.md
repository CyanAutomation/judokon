PRD: Nightly Enhanced JSDoc Generation Automation

⸻

Description

Introduce an automated workflow that scans JavaScript source files nightly to detect undocumented functions and insert intelligently generated JSDoc comments. The system analyzes each function’s parameters and return types using lightweight heuristics, generating basic but meaningful documentation. The updated files are committed to a branch, and a pull request is automatically opened for review. This ensures that the codebase maintains a high level of documentation hygiene with minimal manual effort.

Problem Statement

Currently, documenting JavaScript functions with JSDoc is a manual, repetitive task often neglected by developers due to time constraints and low perceived immediate value. As the codebase grows, the lack of documentation reduces maintainability, onboarding speed for new developers, and increases technical debt. Without an automated system, it is impractical to ensure consistent and timely documentation updates.

There is a risk that gaps in function documentation can lead to misunderstandings, misuse of code, and increased bugs, especially in larger or distributed teams.

⸻

Impact if Not Solved
	•	Decreased code maintainability and readability.
	•	Increased onboarding time for new developers.
	•	Higher risk of introducing bugs due to unclear function behavior.
	•	Growing technical debt and documentation backlog.

⸻

Behavioral Insight

Developers are more likely to maintain and improve documentation when provided with high-quality, automatically generated baselines. Providing structured but editable JSDoc comments lowers the barrier to achieving full documentation coverage, especially when developers are relieved from manually creating initial comment blocks.

⸻

Goals
	•	Automate the detection and documentation of undocumented JavaScript functions.
	•	Insert intelligently generated JSDoc comments based on parameter and return type heuristics.
	•	Open a pull request nightly with all updated documentation for human review and approval.
	•	Maintain zero disruption to existing Prettier and ESLint formatting and linting pipelines.
	•	Ensure no empty pull requests are created; only real changes trigger pull requests.

Functional Requirements

Priority 1 (P1)
	•	Parse .js files nightly to find undocumented function declarations, class methods, and arrow functions.
	•	For each undocumented function:
	•	Generate a JSDoc comment with:
	•	A placeholder description.
	•	Parameter annotations inferred based on name patterns and default values.
	•	Return type inferred based on function return analysis.
	•	Omit @returns if the function does not return a meaningful value (void).
	•	Insert generated JSDoc as a leading block comment without TODO markers.
	•	Create a pull request to the main branch only if documentation changes are detected.
	•	Label the pull request as automated and documentation.
	•	Allow manual triggering of the workflow via workflow_dispatch.

Priority 2 (P2)
	•	Ensure the script avoids redundant documentation if a valid JSDoc block already exists.
	•	Ensure the generated pull request auto-assigns to the workflow initiator (or bot account).
	•	Auto-delete the pull request branch once merged.
	•	Allow force-push of the branch to maintain a single PR with the latest nightly updates.

Priority 3 (P3)
	•	Support extension to TypeScript in the future with minimal refactoring.
	•	Allow easy customization of parameter and return type heuristics.
	•	Future-proof for enhancement with summary comments (e.g., number of functions documented).

⸻

Acceptance Criteria
	•	Script parses all .js files except those in ignored folders (node_modules, dist).
	•	Functions without JSDoc receive a generated comment with inferred types.
	•	Pull request is only created if at least one file was modified.
	•	Pull request includes:
	•	Clear title: chore: Enhanced Auto-generate JSDoc Comments
	•	Description summarizing purpose.
	•	Labels: automated, documentation.
	•	No pull request is created if no changes are needed.
	•	The script does not interfere with existing Prettier or ESLint workflows.
	•	Pull request branch is automatically deleted after merge.
