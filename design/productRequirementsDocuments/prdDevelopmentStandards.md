# PRD: Development Standards

## TL;DR

This PRD defines comprehensive development standards for the JU-DO-KON! project, covering code quality, documentation, naming conventions, and UI design principles. It consolidates scattered standards into a single source of truth to ensure consistent, maintainable, and accessible code across all features. These standards support both human developers and AI agents in producing high-quality, well-documented code that follows established patterns and practices.

---

## Problem Statement

Inconsistent development practices across the JU-DO-KON! codebase lead to reduced maintainability, slower onboarding, and increased technical debt. Without unified standards for coding, documentation, and UI design, developers spend excessive time understanding existing code patterns and may inadvertently introduce inconsistencies. This particularly impacts AI agents, which require clear, consistent patterns to generate appropriate code suggestions and maintain quality standards.

---

## Goals

- **Consistency**: Establish uniform coding patterns, documentation styles, and naming conventions
- **Maintainability**: Enable faster code comprehension and modification through clear standards
- **Quality**: Reduce defects and technical debt through structured development practices
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Accelerate developer onboarding with well-documented standards
- **AI Agent Effectiveness**: Provide clear patterns for automated code generation and review

---

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want clear coding standards so that I can write consistent, maintainable code
- As a new team member, I want comprehensive documentation standards so that I can quickly understand the codebase
- As a code reviewer, I want established naming patterns so that I can efficiently evaluate code quality
- As an AI agent, I want structured pseudocode standards so that I can generate appropriate documentation
- As a UI developer, I want unified design standards so that I can create consistent user interfaces

## Prioritized Functional Requirements

| Priority | Feature | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| P1 | JSDoc Documentation Standards | Mandatory documentation format for all public functions and classes |
| P1 | Function Naming Conventions | Consistent prefix-based naming patterns (create, setup, is) |
| P1 | Pseudocode Documentation | Structured high-level logic descriptions using @pseudocode marker |
| P1 | Code Quality Rules | Function length limits, modularity requirements, and refactoring guidelines |
| P2 | UI Design System Integration | Component design patterns, color systems, and accessibility standards |
| P2 | Settings Page Guidelines | Specific layout and structure requirements for settings interfaces |
| P3 | Advanced Documentation | Additional JSDoc tags and specialized documentation patterns |

## Functional Requirements

### 1. JSDoc Documentation Standards (P1)

**Required Format:**
- Use block comments `/** ... */` for all public functions, classes, and modules
- Start with single-sentence summary describing function purpose
- Document parameters with `@param {Type} name - Description` format
- Document return values with `@returns {Type} Description` format
- Indicate optional parameters with square brackets: `@param {string} [optionalParam]`
- Include default values in parameter descriptions when applicable

**Example:**
```javascript
/**
 * Build the card carousel HTML elements.
 * @param {Array<Object>} cards - Array of card data to be displayed.
 * @param {HTMLElement} container - The DOM element where carousel will be injected.
 * @param {boolean} [autoplay=false] - Whether to automatically advance carousel.
 * @returns {void}
 */
function buildCarousel(cards, container, autoplay = false) { ... }
```

**Quality Requirements:**
- Documentation must match actual function signature
- Brief, clear descriptions using imperative style
- No modification of comments marked with `@pseudocode`

### 2. Function Naming Conventions (P1)

**Prefix-Based Patterns:**
- `createX` - Factory functions returning DOM nodes or component objects
- `setupY` - Functions attaching event listeners or initializing behavior  
- `isZ` - Predicate helpers returning boolean values
- `handleX` - Event handler functions
- `loadX` - Data loading and fetching functions

**Grouping Requirements:**
- Group related functions by concern within modules
- Use consistent prefixes to indicate function purpose
- Maintain alphabetical ordering within prefix groups

### 3. Pseudocode Documentation (P1)

**Format Requirements:**
- Use `@pseudocode` marker at beginning of pseudocode blocks
- Employ numbered list format for step-by-step logic
- Focus on **why** operations occur, not just **what** happens
- Use imperative style ("Initialize", "Render", "Handle")
- Place only where adding value for complex functions

**Example:**
```javascript
/**
 * Populates the bottom navigation bar with game modes.
 *
 * @pseudocode
 * 1. Load mode definitions from gameModes.json
 * 2. Fetch navigationItems.js for display order and visibility
 * 3. Merge navigation items with mode data by matching id field
 * 4. Filter out hidden items and keep only main menu entries
 * 5. Sort remaining items by order value
 * 6. Generate HTML list items for each merged object
 * 7. Update navigation bar with generated HTML
 * 8. Handle errors gracefully with fallback messaging
 */
```

### 4. Code Quality Standards (P1)

**Function Complexity:**
- Maximum 50 lines per function
- Single responsibility principle enforcement
- Extract helper functions for complex logic blocks
- Avoid deep nesting (maximum 3 levels)

**Modularity Requirements:**
- Group helpers by functional concern
- Clear module boundaries and dependencies
- Consistent export patterns
- Minimal public API surface

### 5. UI Design System Integration (P2)

**Core Design Principles:**
- Touch-first interaction (minimum 48x48px targets)
- Responsive feedback for all interactions
- Visual hierarchy with clear information prioritization
- Progressive disclosure of complex features
- WCAG AA accessibility compliance
- Consistent component reuse patterns

**Color System:**
- Primary: #CB2504 (buttons, highlights)
- Structured token-based color usage
- High contrast requirements for accessibility
- Consistent application across components

**Component Structure:**
- Flat color with geometric background textures
- Layered card layouts with z-depth
- Emphasis typography (caps, bold, white-on-color)
- Panelled layout with modular sections

### 6. Settings Page Guidelines (P2)

**Layout Requirements:**
- Section grouping with `<fieldset>` elements and descriptive `<legend>` titles
- Consistent form structure across all sections
- Settings item containers using `<div class="settings-item">`
- Responsive grid layout using `.game-mode-toggle-container` class

**Structure Template:**
```html
<div class="settings-item">
  <label for="example-toggle">Example Toggle</label>
  <p class="settings-description">Explains what the option does.</p>
</div>
```

**Responsive Design:**
- 3-column layout on desktop
- 1-column stacked layout on mobile
- Logical keyboard navigation order
- Simultaneous section display (no collapsible containers)
