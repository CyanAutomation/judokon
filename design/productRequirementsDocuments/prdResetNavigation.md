# PRD: Reset Navigation Cache

## Overview

The "Reset Navigation Cache" feature allows users to manually clear cached navigation data (`navigationItems`) via the storage helper and refresh the navigation bar from the Settings page. This is useful for troubleshooting, ensuring up-to-date navigation, and supporting advanced users or testers.

## Problem Statement

Users and testers may encounter issues where the navigation bar does not reflect the latest updates due to cached data. Without a manual reset option, resolving such issues requires clearing all browser storage or waiting for cache expiration, which is inconvenient and non-obvious.

## Goals

- Allow users to clear cached navigation data without leaving the app or using browser tools
- Ensure the navigation bar is refreshed immediately after cache reset
- Make the feature discoverable only when the relevant feature flag is enabled

## User Stories

- As a power user or tester, I want to clear the navigation cache so that I can see the latest navigation updates without reloading or clearing all storage.
- As a developer, I want to provide a way to reset navigation data for debugging and support purposes.

## Prioritized Functional Requirements

| Priority | Feature                       | Description                                                                                 |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P1       | Reset Navigation Cache Button | When enabled via feature flag, show a button in Settings that clears navigationItems cache. |
| P1       | Immediate Navbar Refresh      | After cache reset, the navigation bar is repopulated with fresh data.                       |
| P2       | Snackbar Confirmation         | Show a snackbar/toast confirming the cache was cleared.                                     |
| P2       | Feature Flag Control          | Button is only visible when the navCacheResetButton feature flag is enabled.                |

## Acceptance Criteria

- The "Reset Navigation Cache" button appears in the Settings page only when the navCacheResetButton feature flag is enabled.
- Clicking the button removes the `navigationItems` entry using `src/helpers/storage.js`.
- After clicking, the navigation bar is immediately refreshed with up-to-date navigation items.
- A snackbar or toast message appears confirming the cache was cleared.
- The button is not visible when the feature flag is disabled.
- No errors are shown if `navigationItems` is already missing from storage.

## Non-Functional Requirements / Design Considerations

- The feature must not disrupt other settings or cached data.
- The UI must remain accessible and keyboard-navigable.
- The operation should complete within 100ms on modern devices.

## Dependencies and Open Questions

- Depends on the navigation bar population logic (`populateNavbar`) and the storage helper.
- Relies on the feature flag system for conditional UI display.
- See [Navigation Bar](prdNavigationBar.md) for hover and active state requirements to ensure UI consistency after cache reset.
- No known open questions.
