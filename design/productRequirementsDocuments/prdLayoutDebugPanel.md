# PRD: Layout Debug Panel

## Overview

The Layout Debug Panel is a developer-facing feature that visually outlines all visible elements on the page. It is toggled via a switch in the Settings page and is intended to assist with UI layout debugging and accessibility checks during development.

## Problem Statement

Developers and designers need a quick way to visually inspect the structure and boundaries of all visible elements in the application. Without such a tool, diagnosing layout issues or verifying UI consistency is time-consuming and error-prone.

## Goals

- Enable developers to toggle a visual outline on all visible elements for layout inspection.
- Ensure the feature is easily accessible from the Settings page.
- Do not impact end-user experience when disabled.

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to toggle a layout debug mode so that I can see the outlines of all visible elements for easier UI debugging.
- As a designer, I want to verify that all containers and components are aligned and sized as intended.

## Prioritized Functional Requirements

| Priority | Feature                    | Description                                                                 |
| -------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P1       | Toggle Layout Debug Panel  | Add a switch in the Settings page to enable/disable the layout debug panel. |
| P1       | Visual Outlines            | When enabled, all visible elements matching the selector are outlined.      |
| P2       | Custom Selector Support    | Allow specifying custom selectors for outlining (default: all visible).     |
| P3       | Remove Outlines on Disable | All outlines are removed when the panel is disabled.                        |

## Acceptance Criteria

- Toggling the switch in Settings immediately adds or removes outlines on all visible elements.
- Outlines are only visible when the debug panel is enabled.
- No outlines remain after disabling the panel.
- The feature does not affect normal gameplay or user experience when off.
- (P2) If custom selectors are provided, only those elements are outlined.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- No performance degradation when toggling the panel on/off.
- Outlines must be visually distinct and not interfere with element content.
- Feature is only visible to users with access to the Settings page.

## Dependencies and Open Questions

- Relies on the Settings page and layoutDebugPanel.js helper.
- Should this feature be hidden or restricted in production builds?
- Should keyboard shortcuts be supported for toggling?
