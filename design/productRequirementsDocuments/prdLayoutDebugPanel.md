# PRD: Layout Debug Panel

## Overview

The Layout Debug Panel is a developer-facing feature that visually outlines all visible elements on the page. It is toggled via a switch in the Settings page and is intended to assist with UI layout debugging and accessibility checks during development.

## Problem Statement

Developers and designers frequently face challenges when diagnosing layout misalignments or inconsistent component sizing in the UI. For example, a designer may notice that a card's padding looks off but has no way to inspect it visually without diving into browser dev tools. Without a quick in-app visual inspection tool, debugging layout issues becomes time-consuming and error-prone, leading to longer QA cycles and the risk of overlooking subtle bugs. This feature addresses that friction and accelerates feedback loops.

## Goals

- Enable developers to toggle a layout debug mode from the Settings page.
- Render visual outlines on 100% of visible elements (or matching custom selectors) quickly.
- Ensure the feature is accessible only in development mode or for authorized roles.
- Confirm that outlines are non-disruptive and visually distinct on all standard UI backgrounds.
- Ensure zero performance degradation or UI alteration when the debug panel is disabled.

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to toggle a layout debug mode so that I can see the outlines of all visible elements for easier UI debugging.
- As a designer, I want to verify that all containers and components are aligned and sized as intended.

## Prioritized Functional Requirements

| Priority | Feature                    | Description                                                                                                                   |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P1       | Toggle Layout Debug Panel  | Add a switch in the Settings page to enable/disable the layout debug panel. Only accessible to dev users.                     |
| P1       | Visual Outlines            | When enabled, apply a 1px dashed outline to all visible elements via default selector `body *`.                               |
| P2       | Custom Selector Support    | Allow developers to input custom CSS selectors for outlining specific elements. Invalid selectors are ignored with a warning. |
| P3       | Remove Outlines on Disable | All outlines must be removed and cleaned from DOM styles when disabled.                                                       |

## Defined Player Actions & Game Flow

- The user opens the Settings page.
- Scrolls to the Developer Tools section.
- Toggles the "Layout Debug Panel" switch.
- If ON: outlines appear immediately on all visible elements or those matching a custom selector.
- If OFF: all outlines are removed cleanly from the DOM.
- Input for custom selectors is shown only when the toggle is ON.
- Invalid selectors trigger a non-blocking warning.
- No UI flickering occurs during toggling.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Toggling the switch in Settings immediately adds or removes outlines on all visible elements.
- Outlines are only visible when the debug panel is enabled.
- No outlines remain after disabling the panel.
- The feature does not affect normal gameplay or user experience when off.
- (P2) If custom selectors are provided, only those elements are outlined.
- Selector input validates for correct syntax and ignores invalid selectors without crashing.

## Player Settings

- The toggle appears in the Developer Tools section of the Settings page.
- Default state: OFF.
- Visible only to users in development mode or with the dev role.

## Visuals or UX Reference

- Outline color: Red `#FF0000` dashed 1px borders (colorblind-visible).
- Do not interfere with UI interactivity or pointer events.
- Avoid flashing or flickering when toggling.
- Support dark/light themes: outlines should contrast against all backgrounds.
- Suggested click target size for toggle and input: minimum 40px.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- No performance degradation when toggling the panel on/off.
- Outlines must be clearly visible (1px dashed red) and must not overlap with in-game or UI elements.
- The debug panel UI and outlines must not persist across user sessions.
- Feature only visible to users with dev role or in dev environment.

## Edge Cases / Failure States

- If a custom selector is invalid, show a warning and apply no outlines.
- If no elements match a valid custom selector, display a message: "No matching elements found."
- If the DOM is still loading, the feature must delay applying outlines until after `DOMContentLoaded`.
- If toggled on and off rapidly, only the latest toggle action is respected.

## Dependencies and Open Questions

- Relies on the Settings page and `layoutDebugPanel.js` helper.
- Should this feature be restricted in production builds? Recommendation: yes.
- Should keyboard shortcuts be supported for toggling? Recommendation: defer to UX evaluation.
