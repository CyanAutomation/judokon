# JU-DO-KON! Settings Page Design Guidelines

To ensure the **Settings** page remains consistent, visually appealing, and accessible as new features are added, developers and AI agents should follow these guidelines. The goal is to preserve a unified layout and style while maintaining high accessibility standards.

## 📐 Layout Guidelines

- **Section Grouping with Fieldsets**  
  Organize settings into logical sections using `<fieldset>` elements with descriptive `<legend>` titles. Each section (e.g. “Display Settings”, “General Settings”, “Game Modes”) should group related controls.  
  _Example: The page currently has a “General Settings” fieldset for toggles like Sound, Navigation Map, and Motion._

- **Consistent Form Structure**  
  Use one `<form>` per section or a single form containing multiple `<fieldset>`s. Ensure consistency across all sections.

- **Settings Item Container**  
  Wrap each setting control in a `<div class="settings-item">` for modularity and consistent spacing.

- **Grid Layout for Controls**  
  Use the `.game-mode-toggle-container` class on fieldsets to enable responsive grid layouts:
  - 3-column layout on desktop
  - 1-column stacked layout on mobile

- **Responsive Design Preservation**  
  New settings should stack vertically on mobile and arrange into columns on larger screens without breaking layout.

- **Page Hierarchy**  
  Maintain a logical top-down structure: main title `<h1>`, followed by fieldsets in an intuitive order (e.g. general → game-specific → advanced).

- **Navigation and Tab Order**  
  Place controls in top-down, left-to-right order in the HTML to preserve logical keyboard navigation.

## 🎨 Styling Guidelines

- **Use Existing Classes**  
  - `.settings-form` on form/fieldset wrappers  
  - `.settings-item` on individual setting containers

- **Fieldset Styling**  
  Reuse section `<legend>` headings with consistent styles (font: Russo One, 24px).

- **Toggle Switch Pattern**  
  Use the existing custom toggle structure:
  ```html
  <label for="new-toggle-id" class="switch">
    <input type="checkbox" id="new-toggle-id" name="newSetting" aria-label="New Setting Name" />
    <div class="slider round"></div>
    <span>New Setting Name</span>
  </label>

  Select Boxes / Radio Buttons
Use standard <select> or <input type="radio">, styled within the form using built-in styles (dark background, padding, rounded borders).
Typography
Headings: Russo One
Body text: use base font set in base.css
Colors
Use CSS variables: --color-primary, --button-bg, etc.
Do not hard-code color values.
Ensure all new elements work across Light, Dark, and Gray themes.
Spacing and Sizing
Use --space-sm, --space-md, etc. for margins/padding
Minimum input height: 48px for tap targets
♿ Accessibility & UX Guidelines

Keyboard Navigation
All controls must be focusable with Tab
Use visible focus indicators (do not remove outlines)
ARIA Labels and Roles
Use <label> where possible
For custom toggles, add aria-label to <input>
Fieldsets should include meaningful <legend>
Screen Reader Considerations
State changes must be announced via native semantics
Use role="alert" for error messages if needed
Avoid hiding important content visually or semantically
Color Contrast
Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for text
Test readability in all themes
Visible Indicators and Feedback
Settings must provide immediate visual feedback
Toggle positions, colors, and states must be unambiguous
Touch and Click Target Size
Minimum target size: 44px × 44px
Ensure padding/margins make elements easy to interact with
Consistent UX Behavior
No "Save" button – all changes are instant
Use existing updateSetting() pattern for persistence
Reflect current saved values on page load
Integrate with existing error feedback mechanisms
Testing Checklist
After adding a setting:
 Can it be focused with Tab?
 Is it labeled for screen readers?
 Does it follow tab order logically?
 Does it work in all display modes?
 Is it keyboard operable?
 Does it use appropriate styles and classes?
By following these layout, styling, and accessibility guidelines, any additional features will blend seamlessly into the Settings page. The result will be a settings interface that scales with new options while remaining organized, visually cohesive, and usable for all players
