# Pseudocode Description Standards

## Problem Statement

Clear pseudocode descriptions are essential for explaining the underlying logic and structure of complex code. They provide high-level insight into the intended workflow, enabling better collaboration, easier debugging, and faster onboarding of new developers. Without detailed pseudocode, complex functions and workflows become opaque and harder to maintain.

---

## Goals

- **Clarity**: Ensure that code logic is easy to grasp through structured pseudocode.
- **Maintainability**: Keep pseudocode descriptions updated as logic evolves.
- **Consistency**: Apply a uniform approach to pseudocode formatting.
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Enable developers to understand the logical flow without reading every line of code.

## Standards

### Pseudocode Standards

- Provide high-level pseudocode comments above logical blocks.
- Use the `@pseudocode` marker at the beginning of pseudocode blocks to distinguish them from other comments.
- Explain **why** the code is performing certain actions, not just **what** it is doing.
- Use a clear, step-by-step, numbered list format for pseudocode within documentation blocks.
- Maintain concise and grammatically correct language.
- Use an imperative style ("Initialize", "Render", "Handle", etc.).
- Avoid restating code line-by-line â€” focus on logical operations and workflows.
- Place pseudocode only where it adds value, especially for complex functions and workflows.

**Example:**

```javascript
/**
 * Populates the bottom navigation bar with game modes from a JSON file.
 *
 * @pseudocode
 * 1. Fetch the JSON file containing game modes ("gameModes.json").
 *    - If the fetch fails, log an error and display an error message.
 *
 * 2. Parse the JSON response to retrieve game modes.
 *    - Handle parsing errors gracefully.
 *
 * 3. Filter game modes to include only visible, main menu items.
 *
 * 4. Sort game modes by the specified order.
 *
 * 5. Generate HTML list items for each mode.
 *
 * 6. Update the navigation bar with the generated HTML.
 *
 * 7. Handle any errors during the process gracefully.
 */
function populateNavigationBar() { ... }
```

## Language and Style

- Write pseudocode in clear, plain English.
- Use proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
- Maintain a neutral, professional tone.
- Prefer clarity over brevity; detailed, understandable pseudocode is better than overly terse descriptions.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Complex functions and workflows include detailed pseudocode.
- Pseudocode is structured as a step-by-step numbered list.
- All pseudocode blocks must begin with the `@pseudocode` marker.
- No pseudocode restates code line-by-line; focus on logical structure.
- Pseudocode explanations are updated as code logic changes.
- Functions without clear, self-explanatory code must have a pseudocode overview.

---

## Edge Cases and Failure States

- **Missing Pseudocode**: Complex workflows without pseudocode cannot be merged.
- **Outdated Pseudocode**: Pseudocode that no longer reflects the current logic must be corrected during review.
- **Missing Marker**: Pseudocode blocks without the `@pseudocode` marker must be updated to include it.
- **Overly Detailed Pseudocode**: Avoid turning pseudocode into a line-by-line transcript of the code.

---

## Additional Notes

- Pseudocode should describe logic, not syntax.
- Use pseudocode to communicate intent and structure, especially where complex control flows or data manipulations are involved.
- The `@pseudocode` marker ensures that pseudocode blocks are easily identifiable and can be excluded from automated processing or formatting tools.
