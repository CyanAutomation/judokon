# JSDoc Commenting Standards

## Problem Statement

Clear and consistent JSDoc documentation is essential for maintaining code quality, facilitating collaboration, and enabling fast onboarding of new developers. Without structured JSDoc comments, codebases become difficult to understand, maintain, and extend over time. Poor documentation leads to reduced development velocity, increased technical debt, and greater risk of introducing defects.

---

## Goals

- **Readability**: Ensure that code is easy to understand through clear JSDoc documentation.
- **Maintainability**: Keep JSDoc comments accurate and up-to-date alongside code changes.
- **Consistency**: Apply a uniform style and structure for all JSDoc comments.
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Enable new developers to comprehend codebase logic and intent quickly.

## Standards

### JSDoc Standards

- Use block comments `/** ... */` for all public functions, classes, and modules.
- Start with a brief, single-sentence summary describing the functionâ€™s purpose.
- Document each parameter with `@param`, specifying:
  - Parameter type using `{Type}` syntax.
  - Parameter name.
  - Brief description.
- Document the return value with `@returns`, specifying:
  - Return type.
  - Brief description.
- Indicate optional parameters with square brackets, e.g., `@param {string} [optionalParam]`.
- Mention default values in the parameter description if applicable.
- Always match documentation with the actual function signature.

**Example:**

```javascript
/**
 * Build the card carousel HTML elements.
 * @param {Array<Object>} cards - Array of card data to be displayed.
 * @param {HTMLElement} container - The DOM element where carousel will be injected.
 * @returns {void}
 */
function buildCarousel(cards, container) { ... }
```

## Language and Style

- Comments must be written in clear, plain English.
- Use proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
- Maintain a neutral, professional tone.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- 100% of exported classes, functions, and modules have structured JSDoc blocks.
- Functions longer than 20 lines include a summary comment unless self-explanatory.
- All public APIs document parameters and return values accurately.
- No commented-out code or obsolete TODOs in the committed code.
- Pull requests must update JSDoc documentation when function signatures or logic change.

---

## Edge Cases and Failure States

- **Missing Documentation**: Code missing required JSDoc comments cannot be merged.
- **Outdated Comments**: PR reviewers must verify that JSDoc comments match the current code.
- **Complex Workarounds**: Any workaround or technical debt must include a JSDoc comment and reference to a tracking issue.

---

## Additional Notes

- Prefer clarity over brevity; a longer, clearer comment is better than a short, confusing one.
- Use standard formats like JSDoc for compatibility with documentation generation tools.
- Self-documenting code is the ideal; comments should supplement, not replace, clear code.
